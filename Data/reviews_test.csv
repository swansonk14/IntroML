-1	B002HQAXUW	A17ESTP5T7T1PH	Rip off Price	These singles sell for $2.50 - $3.36 at the store for 1 box of 24 singles. I'm not sure why Amazon is selling it for $9.99 for a box of 24 singles.  Hazelnut coffee creamer is my favorite, but truly this is not a good buy.	1	0
1	B007TJGZ54	ACM6X1Q9R2K81	best k-cups	Have tried many varieties of K cups and green mountain is the best. My favorite blend is breakfast blend. Mild coffee, if you like Dunkin Donuts, you will like this.  If you are a starbucks drinker, try a bolder blend.	44	0
1	B001EO7LQC	A3RO8EWFXJSMLB	WONDERFUL SWEDISH PANCAKES	These make GREAT Swedish pancakes and are less expensive than other brands.  Also, since I don't keep flour around the house, it is great to have when a recipe calls for a few tablespoons of flour.  My family is always happy when I take out the box of Kungsomen Swedish Pancake mix and the crepe pan on the weekends!!	0	0
1	B001HTJ49G	A2J831LFSPG5D1	Terrific Snack	These were purchased for my husband.  He declares them an excellent snack food and says these are very tasty, crisp and fresh.  Since we have not been able to find these in a local grocery store, it is nice to be able to order them from Amazon.  We definitely plan to order more when our supply runs low.	1	0
1	B001RVFDOO	A3ABKJ4THITBUG	Different and yummy!	I agree with reviewers who enjoy this alternative to the regular salty snack options.  The texture of the chips is great and they're very flavorful!  I can certainly taste the sodium but if this isn't a problem for you, I would recommend trying them.  It's a snack I look forward to having a chance to enjoy.  Everyone has their favorite flavor (i'm no exception -BBQ FTW!) so I recommend trying the variety pack first.  I thought I'd have at least one or two flavors we'd 'hate', but no.<br /><br />My initial purchase of an alternative snack was Stacy's Pita Chips in Parmesan Garlic & Herb.  Nothing against them, but they lacked the flavor punch I was looking for.  These Popchips are exactly right.<br /><br />I can definitely recommend these chips for anyone who likes a salty, flavorful snack!	0	0
1	B000RI8GI8	A213X276W8GR1W	Exactly like Atomic Fireballs	If you love cinnamon candy, this is your energy drink... tastes awesome and has one hell of a kick, great for mixed drinks as well.	0	0
1	B000FFVYFA	AGX5A9BYYI1TU	Best product in the marketplace.	These bars are delicious and full of protein from walnuts and almonds that are alleged to be protective against cancer.<br />What a great use of candy: to give voice to MODERATES in the Middle East.<br />This is a company worthy of our support.	0	1
1	B001P3NU30	A2MD5YE1PDTRFN	Great Daily Treat for my Dog	Our veterinarian suggested these for our dog to replace the raw hide chips we were giving him so our dog gets the benefits of the teeth cleaning. I was worried our dog might not like them since the raw hide chips I was buying were heavily coated in flavoring but he actually likes them just as much. These are definitely his favorite treats and I'm happy knowing they also help keep his teeth clean. The package arrived on time from the seller.	3	0
-1	B000KV61FC	A2LQ80A1XCTURL	Too fragile...	"Too fragile for my pup. He bit right through the rubber ""rope."" I think it lasted about 45 minutes. Granted he is an adolescent AmStaf, but I still had higher hopes. We are sticking to our Kongs (filled with low sodium chicken broth and frozen overnight)."	6	0
1	B0049M7LES	A3DAW23IC0BYHJ	Great Flavor	This popcorn is great, and even comes in Smart Pop at lower calories. I always have both for the me and the grandkids.	0	0
-1	B0057RTMJ6	ASVA9JTVJWB34	Misleading AD	Be very careful.  I expected 300x3, but they sent 100x3, a total of 300 units.  You can do a lot better with other sellers whose advertising isn't deceptive.	0	3
1	B004LOJGBU	A1BR2U9YITHOF5	You do not need sight to find it!	The smell of the truffle is wonderful and escapes from the packaging before you can get to the bottle, what a lovely aroma. The salt is delicious over simply broiled or steamed veggies such as Asparagus or broccoli. Good high quality salt and truffle. Yum!	1	0
1	B000YSTH16	A11MHK2DTJEF6N	Very good cookie	Like a lot of gluten free foods there is a tendancy to crumble, but these arrived in very good condition.  The vanilla flavoring stands out.  Very good for light snacking or dessert.	0	0
1	B001LNZEYM	A2PNOU7NXB1JE4	Another great Lakewood product!	I've purchased several juice flavors from this brand, organic and non-organic and have not been disappointed. I bought the organic version at harris teeter which is a grocery store chain for four ninety nine. The juice is not real sweet, almost like eating a mouthful of pitted bing cherries without having to chew. I also add it to a lot of things for flavor and color swirls, namely Oetker's organic vanilla pudding, yellow cake mix, white frosting, pancake mix, and lemon poppy-seed muffins. Thus far Amazon has the best prices on Oetker products for my area. This juice is also very good to freeze as popsicles. I've thought about making a sorbet, but haven't yet.	3	0
1	B000EVMNNC	AP8JWRAMSNPDN	Great flavor!	If you like pink grapefruit, you will love this product! I am a huge pink grapefruit lover and I really didn't expect a lot when I decided to buy these and give them a try...THEY ARE INCREDIBLE!!!!!<br /><br />They look like a grapefruit section, and they are coated with sugar. These are delicious and would go great at any party or just to have as a little treat!<br /><br />Other people have said that they are good in small doses, but I wouldn't want more than 5-6 pieces at a time anyway, or else I would weigh 600 pounds! These are perfect to have around for a little treat for the kids or friends. I will definitely purchase these again!	2	0
1	B000B9SFP2	A1GNYV0RA0EQSS	Easy Assembly - Great for Alpacas!	"This product is both effective and convenient. We were able to assemble it and have it working within 30 minutes. It worked great as a ""maternity ward"" for our alpaca millay and her new cria. We were able to give them some private time while not feeling as though they were separated from the herd. I highly recommend this product and will have many uses for it in the future! Please view our pictures we have provided in the customer photo section!!"	1	0
1	B001AJ1ULS	A364DHK3SA6HEE	My dogs are loving these, thinly sliced so easy to chew	I don't think everything from China is crappy, though I do think it pays to be vigilant EVERYWHERE these days.  But cage free in the US and in China doesn't mean happy chickens either place - it just means they're in a barn (usually without light) - check out Food, Inc. and many other documentaries.  If it were natural for my dogs, I'd have them go vegan too, but right now I do what I can with the humans in our family and try to pick what seems to be the least harmful to all other sentient creatures sharing this planet.<br />So that being said, this product compares to other chicken jerky products for dogs out there just fine and to boot does not have hormones.  Also, the individual slices are thinner than many other brands which helps the dogs chew these properly (fewer larger chunks swallowed).  The price is great to boot - I highly recommend these and will be buying more (at least until there is some healthy vegan jerky for dogs that I can afford!)	0	1
-1	B006WJHOX4	A240JPZ4EINMDJ	Contains GMOs! We say NO!	"Kellogg's Raisin Bran contains unlabeled genetically modified ingredients and Kellogg doesn't want you to know this. They contributed $632,500 to a propaganda campaign in California to try to trick people into voting against Prop. 37, which would require that genetically engineered foods be labeled. Raisin Bran contains GMO Bt corn and GMO sugar derived from GMO sugar beet. Both were developed and patented by chemical companies. GMO Bt corn is an EPA registered pesticide. It has been genetically engineered by forcing a foreign gene that makes its own pesticide into the plant DNA. Every cell of this plant is a pesticide factory. When corn worms bite into it, their stomachs explode. Both the sugar and the corn have foreign genes for herbicide resistance forced into their DNA. The plants are made to resist high levels of RoundUp. The active chemical ingredient in RoundUp, a chemical called glyphosate, has been linked to birth defects, inflammatory bowel disease, cancer and more. These GMOs have been snuck into our food supply without telling us. 50 countries around the world require that GMOs be labeled (including all of Europe, China, Russia, Japan, Australia, Brazil and India). In the US there is currently NO labeling law. The FDA does NOT require long term, peer reviewed studies to determine if GMOs are really safe. They let the chemical companies that patent these ""foods"" decide. How can this be when the FDA is there to protect us? WRONG. Just google Michael Taylor, Food Safety Czar and you'll see that he's setting food policy. When it suits him, he uses the revolving door to go back and forth between the FDA and the largest chemical company that is patenting and trying to monopolize our food supply.  Should people be eating this stuff? I wouldn't feed it to my pets. My family is boycotting ALL Kellogg's products."	7	5
1	B000E65OF6	A2DHG1HP5MCGMI	Very good bedtime tea or tea for car or motion sickness!	"I have been purchasing and drinking this tea for years.In fact since Mo Siegel used to advertise it on TV..now that is a long time ago. It really helps calm frazzled adults as well as hyper children before bed. But what is more share worthy is the fact that it is a great tea for children that suffer from motion sickness.<br /> Our oldest daughter used to be car sick all the time. We carried an endless supply of ""baggies"" for her as she would 8 out of 10 times relieve herself when commuting back and forth to school.<br /> We discovered that this tea, given 20 minutes before the ride and every hour or so on long family trips curtailed her horrid events completely. The main ingredient is chamomile and it really helps relieve motion sickness and soothe frazzled nerves."	0	0
-1	B00141UC9I	A22RMVO4OIP86Z	Liver treats seem off...	I have fed the chicken and duck version of these--though now the reviews regarding china I find disturbing.<br /><br />Regardless, the beef liver version of these are not a hit with my pup and seem to be a very odd, plastic texture.<br /><br />The duck and chicken are both great--but I will be investigating the source of the food.	1	1
-1	B00390T5JA	A3O0YHSJS7243V	could be better for the money	I bought this unit because of the Kurig name thinking it would be a quality machine.I have had it  about nine months and have trouble with the pump not filling up the cup on either size.I called Kurig and they had no response other than descale it.For the price of this unit you shouldn't have to descale every week. I am very disappointed with this unit and wouldn't buy another one.I will try either a Cuisinart or Mr Coffee.Kurig lost a customer here hope others fare better than I.	4	1
1	B002QWP89S	A1CQPBL4C0R0A1	best treat	My dogs love these treats! When my dogs wake up in the morning thats the first thing they want to eat! Especially my dog Luna cries for one. When I say greenie, she immediately runs downstairs and sit right in front of the pantry for one. I highly recommend these treats!	0	0

1	B000ER6YO0	A7INGAHQIWQ1	No Issues	I don't know how everyone else got these broken, but when I received them they came wrapped in plastic and in bubble wrap, not a single jar was broken.  My son loves them and the price was great and I had no issues at all.	1	0
1	B000EVT04C	A370FTMPRF0AIK	Huge pack of chewy gummies	These strawberry gummies have just the right flavor and are a great chew.<br />This 5 pound bag goes a long way and is full of flavor.<br />If you are into baking, they make a nice decoration for the top of cupcakes or a cake.<br />These candies are eye pleasers complete with strawberry looking green tops and raised places on the strawberry denoting seeds.  Kids will love them because they are cute as well as tasty.	0	0

1	B000G6RYNE	A27YPCR3ZXWVFE	So Delicious...Yet my companions wont touch them.	Great chips, great price.  Odds are that you will have them to yourself.  If you like your fish and chips soaked in malt vinegar, you will love these.  The best salt and vinegar chips I have ever had (and I love this flavor, mind you).  They are spectacular with deli sandwiches or on their own.  Since I have found that S&V is palatable to only the most intelligent of our species I know that my afternoon snack is all mine, unless of course I run into another heavy brained, hearty breathed like mind.  -Summary- If you like the taste of bitter sweet salty vinegar and a crispy chip to boot you wont pucker at the sight of these handily bagged morsels.  It is the first and only time I have committed to a whole case of chips and I will do it again.  Mmmmm... vinegar...	1	1
1	B0047E2I5U	A2H245U9P86SFS	Good supplement for raw diet	"I originally purchased this product to serve as my dog's main food since he is allergy-prone with skin issues and a survivor of mast-cell tumor disease.The vet had recommended other ""veterinary prescription"" kibble(potato/ rabbit) which seemed to really slow down our dog's healing process and worse, seemed to be doing more harm than good .  After giving up on vet reco 6 months later, we started experimenting with a number of 'healthy' and 'raw' alternatives, I landed on this just before going 100% raw. Though I have since gone 100% raw and eliminated all grain and processed food from our dog's main diet (with vast noticeable improvements in his health), I still use this food as one of his acceptable 'treats' and when I'm behind in making his raw meals. The texture is the consistency of beef jerky and the pieces are cut pretty small (think holding a small strip between your thumb and index finger about half the size of a fortune cookie paper...  It would be great for training since they are small pieces to feed frequently and more moist than dry kibble. It may be pricey to use as a main food , but it was great quality and seemed to be trustworthy ingredient sources. He likes the taste a lot too... but I can't vouch for that part."	0	0
1	B007M83302	A3GGQC9BRC6ABK	Amazing Chips!	These chips are really good. Crisp and delicious. My favorite flavor is the salt and pepper, my second in the garlic parm, but they were all good. (I'm not even a fan of BBQ anything, but the BBQ chips were alright).<br /><br />Only 110 calories for a small bag. Not to bad if i say so myself.	2	0
1	B001EO5ZMO	AW497M5SEXAPQ	Ahmad Loose Imperial Blend Tea is great for the price	A friend who'd been drinking tea for 80 of his 84 years introduced me to this tea a few months ago. Even took me over to the store and bought me a pound. At $7/lb. in a retail store or a little over $9 with shipping from an online merchant, I think it's great. I've been drinking Earl Grey, English Breakfast, Irish Breakfast, Lapsang Souchong, Assam, etc. Most of them were over $30/lb. with shipping. Aside from the Lapsang Souchong, I think this is a great replacement for all the rest. Has everything I'm looking for in a strong, full-bodied black tea with enough character to keep it from becoming boring. My current favorite afternoon tea. Unless you're extremely jaded or a tea snob, you'll love it.	5	0
1	B001P05K8Q	AH23DK8X53BRG	Perfect Treat	I have two beautiful large rescue dogs, Heidi Sue, two and Loosey Bell, 13 that love the Chews.  All I have to do is say chew-chew and the jumping and barking starts. Heidi finishes hers first and starts barking at Loosey to try to steal her chew.  It is quite a show and amazing such a treat can cause so much fun.  It is such a great product and is recommended by my vet. I only wish the price was lower as it is expensive and not always in my budget. I am glad that Amazon offers several places to buy the treats so I can compare prices. Thank you	0	0
1	B000QUZ9DC	AHJBXA6X0FLRZ	Great	Not quite the Ford gum from years ago, but very good nonetheless. The tub I received was full and the gum was very fresh (soft). I love the red the most, so I wish it had a a lot more of those, but overall a good solid purchase.	0	0

1	B000PDY3P0	AUYNA9G3UVTFM	Perfect Popcorn Every Time	We have been using this for over a year now.  We love it.  It pops perfect popcorn every time. In fact, we like it more than the popcorn at the movie theater.  It is possible to not put all the oil or salt in (with a little practice) if you have guests who want less flavor.  But we think it is perfect the way it is...every time.	0	0
-1	B004ZIER34	A3I9DM8V0M6U6H	Not bitter, but strangely acidic-tasting for low-acid coffee	"The Puroast Low Acid Coffee was initially appealing to me because I suffer from acidic stomach, due in part to my love of coffee.  So, I was excited about the product.  Sure enough, true to advertising, it is not bitter.  So far, so good.  And, I'm going to take their word for it that the coffee is low in acid.  However, for a low-acid coffee, it has a strangely acidic-tasting quality about it.  Can't quite get a handle on it, some kind of funny after-taste that is not pleasant - maybe it's actually an alkaline aftertaste that I'm not used to in a coffee.  At any rate, this has an ""off"" taste to it, like some type of chemical residue has been left in the coffee.<br /><br />One star for taste, 4 stars for being non-bitter and (presumably) low in acid.  Strange product."	0	0
1	B00412W76S	AE9LVM0KKA8RW	Horsetail grass tea bags	Have purchased these tea bas before. I bought them in hope of having stronger . No real success, but will keep trying.<br />Received package in timely manner.	0	1

1	B000G6MBX2	AWZG8HXBE8PNB	Plocky's Rice and Beans Tortilla Chips	I bought these chips, and wanted to try if they were tasty. It sure is!  Unique and different flavor and the right thickness.<br /><br />It remains crunchy, spicy and flavorful with a hint of tabasco and paprika sauce for heat. There are some rice granules embedded with the tortilla chips. However, some of the spices are lacking from this chip. But I liked this very much.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone who wants to try a red beans and rice tortilla chips. Go ahead-- you can put other ingredients as nachos except the cheese.  Maybe some el pastor, shredded meat, tomatoes, etcetera.	0	0
1	B0089SPDUW	A1HYMQV1Z5GLGD	My favorite	Obviously taste is an opinion but in my humble opinion this is the best coffee out there for Keurig and I have tried a billion. I love dark roast but Starbucks' French roast, Sumatra, and others I can't remember off hand seem to taste stale to me or not as bold. Can't stand any of Caribou's other dark roasts, such as Obsidian which you can get at Target sometimes. All in all, I am hoping this one sticks around, Ange's personal fav.	1	0
1	B002BB7EWI	A1QEV11J83426K	Great idea! Yummy product!	My daughter will start school this fall and i was concerned about lunches and fruit-to-go choices. We've bought several different fruit pouches at a local organic store and she and I loved these the most. It it not overly sweet (and a strawberry variation as well), tastes really good. She can easily eat 2 of these every day.<br />I really like the fact that it has no sugar and color added + it is organic. Just fruit puree.<br /><br />I, personally, don't like banana variation, but it's just because of my own personal preferences (i like fresh bananas more than cooked), other than that, my daughter approved all of flavors to 10 stars.	1	0

1	B001HBTGI8	A8FLUHLFP5QIO	Better than the real stuff	This stuff is outragous. It is simply the best olive juice on the market. I tried another brand and it did not come close to Boscoli.

1	B002QWP89S	A1AO8A38JUDVAF	Magic Breath Chews for your dog	I highly recommend these chews for your dog. They do exactly what they say that they will do; freshen your dog's breath!<br /><br />I found them to be significantly cheaper to buy them at Amazon compared to the chain pet stores; at least $10 cheaper as of Sept. 2011.<br /><br />I have read that some dogs do not chew them well enough and have choked. I have not had that happen to my dog but it is probably something you need to take into consideration.<br /><br />My advice is to buy a smaller bag at a pet store first and see if they work for your animal. Then come back and buy them here!	1	0
1	B002QWP89S	A8NX9GKEUAG8U	Dog goes crazy over these!	My dog has been loving these chews for years! I give him one everyday and it has done a great job at keeping plaque and tartar build up at bay.	0	0

-1	B000F4EU52	A38DUAG2FRUMBK	Not Safe!	After reading a previous review I carefully inspected the cans when they arrived. The cans were immaculate and very clean so I felt relieved. After cooling in the fridge I ate the first can. The fruit was very mushy and not attractive to look at and frankly a disapointment but did not taste rotten per say. Only minutes later though my mouth felt like acid was eating at it and was very painful for hours even after washing out my mouth. I eat much canned and fresh fruit and this was a first for me. Only days later my teeth and gums were infected and I had to go to the dentist for the pain was so bad. He found infection and I had to undergo a treatment of antibiotics and painkillers before I was finally ok again after about 2 weeks. SHEESH! Needless to say I threw out the remaining cans of fruit! The problem must be at the source as the cans and packaging were 1st rate and shining clean. Quality control must really suck. I'm all for natural but great care must be taken so contamination is avoided. This is a foreign product and their health standards may be lacking there. I would stay far away from this stuff if you value your health!	8	1
1	B00076TQ1Q	A2DYRRR7YVD61Z	For the Kitchen Artist	Very pleased. Expensive but worth the cost to me because of the beautiful soft luster it adds to my baked goods. Shaker and pour openings for easy application.  Ordering more.	1	1
1	B000F4H5FY	A69H2HEJNH50B	We love tea!	This was bought to be used in our wedding and we couldn't be happier. We have a ton of tea left over and we have been enjoying it. The flavor is good and doesn't taste as though it has been sitting in the boxes for a long time. Twinings is a great company and we have often had their tea in the past and we will probably continue to get it in the future. The box of 6 is a great way to get the bulk you need without paying a ton.	1	0
1	B000G6RYNE	A36QQYEW0AMJEO	Best Chips I've Ever Tasted	Fantastic tasting potato chips. I love the individual bags, great for kids and adults too.

1	B001IZA22W	A6FR266LGUHQR	Boldo is the natural way to treat fat-liver	I found that best way to brew this is to use the drip-style coffee maker. 1 tea bag for 12 cups of coffee. I tried in a pot of hot water but coffee maker extracts the most tea out. It tasted funny at first but it's not unbearable. It's much easier to drink while it's hot or warm. At first, I couldn't drink it cold because of its strong flavor. I also found that this helps with digestion too. After a big holiday meal, I drink this and I never get indigestion.	2	0
1	B004391DK0	A1M17X9Y0L6FBV	Almost as good as non GF!	"I bought this on a whim because I was craving strawberry shortcake... wow! The biscuits can be a bit crumbly, but the texture is not objectionable. The taste was great! I use this for sweet and regular biscuits.<br /><br />We also use this for pancakes, and they are almost indistinguishable from regular pancakes. I add vanilla, a touch of brown sugar and cinnamon for a treat. Yum!<br /><br />Tip - I've found that most gluten free ""bread"" products work better if you let the batter sit for about 15 minutes after mixing the dry and wet ingredients. It seems to activate the batter, which makes the resulting stuff lighter and more moist."	6	0
1	B00016UX0K	A3VMF07EILG8WV	My Favorite Dipping Sauce	Mae Ploy Sweet Chili Sauce is the best. I use it instead of duck sauce. Check it out. Once you try it, you'll be hooked.	0	0
1	B000SATIZA	A1PDFCXL8CU308	Surprisingly good!	This tea is fantastic!  It has a taste that reminds one of cranberries.  The picture is misleading.  The bag is about 4 times the size of a bag of coffee and has a Ziploc-type resealable closure on the top. It's totally worth the money and I highly recommend it!	1	0
1	B002QWP89S	AS0Q5SJAGMVYA	Great!	My dog goes crazy when I mention the word Greenies.  He hasn't put on any extra weight since I have been giving them to him.

The Organic Blend is our favorite - such great flavor with incredible aroma too. Can't wait until tomorrow morning when I get to brew another pot. Weavers is the best coffee kept secret around - not for long I'm sure.	5	1
1	B000F70SO6	A25709ZQ344YMT	yum! nutty, chewy	I'm eating this bar as I write and it it very yummy. Very nutty, not overly sweet or sticky, chewy, with a great little crunch.<br />If you love nuts like I do they're very delicious and if almost a little exotic, like you're treating yourself to a healthy dessert. Satisfying taste and hunger-wise.	0	0

1	B0047E2I5U	A38IS2R2HND51L	Awesome Dog Food	I guess you do really get what you pay for!<br />It's expensive but top quality. There is a huge difference between this and any other dog food. It is real meat, not the garbage meat and garbage meat by-products you get in most dog food that have to be processed for days on end to make them safe.<br />This stuff is the real deal and my dog LOVES it.	0	0
1	B001BDDTB2	A2BCDZO1XQLDH	Kitties love it!	This is a high quality seafood based sampler pack of wet cat food. I have two cats that primarily eat dry food, yet every once in a while they get a can of something. I tried this brand and was impressed. The meat is visible and appears minimally processed (looks like canned tuna, for example). The cats just love it and are awaiting their next turn!	0	0

1	B0006TQ2TS	A3LMV28393LQEQ	Superior quality saffron for a decent price.	I know my saffron. I have tried different brands from different places. I think this is one of the best I have tried. I thought it was a good price for the quantity considering the fact that saffron is the most expensive spice out there. I also like the tin, though I prefer a corked bottle to keep the flavor fresh.	0	0
-1	B000CMD63E	A3O55TG3FKMEJT	Why do they all taste like licorice?	I ordered three different kinds of Yogi tea based on the great reviews -- lemon ginger, stomach ease, and green tea super antioxident. Unfortunately, they all taste exactly the same -- like licorice. If you like licorice flavor, you'll like this tea. If you're looking for something that actually tastes like lemon and ginger, look elsewhere.	1	7

1	B003KLSZGW	A1LFSTBR7L7PUT	super crunch	These are excellent snack crackers, but you need a really good set of teeth to bite into them!  We have eaten them plain but they are probably excellent with cheese also.  The interesting thing is that once you manage to bite a piece off they are not hard to chew!<br /><br />Chock full of healthy seeds, these are great for either a snack or to accompany a bowl of soup or a salad.	0	0

1	B000H27K86	A2UWHKZSPWWJ01	Good on Everything	I originally discovered this years ago on vacation in southern Maryland. Since then it's always been in our cupboard. We came home to PA that year with three cans of it and then resupplied each summer. After a couple of years it became available in our area, but in the last year or so, we haven't been able to find it anywhere. This is one seasoning I don't mind buying by the case. (and it's a great price, too!)<br /><br />We put it on virtually anything - and I mean anything. Meats, poultry, seafood, salads, spaghetti, eggs, pot pie, vegetables, soups, whatever. It's especially good on any pasta dish. I even sprinkle it on a sandwich. The spice is just the right amount of heat with the touch of lemon to top it off. It sounds weird but I think I could even enjoy this on ice cream.	0	0
1	B0013NUGDE	A30NYUHEDLWI0Y	Great  Alternative to Potato Chips	I just love these chips!  I was always a big fan of potato chips, but haven't had one since I discovered popchips.  They are great for dipping or all alone.  I am constantly re-ordering them.  One note however-if you are on a low salt diet these chips are probably not for you. They are high in sodium.  We go through a case every two months.  If you love them it pays to join the subscribe and save program through Amazon.  You save money and stay supplied!	1	0
-1	B001LGGH40	A1A9Q3CQA5Y28E	Way too tart for my taste	I didn't care for this drink at all.  It's almost like eating a sweettart in liquid, carbonated form.  My husband and oldest daughter felt the same way, but my 13 year old liked it.  It is 100% juice though, which is nice to see in a carbonated beverage.	0	0

1	B005FG6KZ8	A2VZD53IMJ6ABS	Soo GOOD!	Cheetos ever since I was kid were one of my favorite snacks,I mean who wouldn't like them? You can't go wrong with the original but decided to give this one a try. I'm not a fan of unbearably hot foods but I do like things with with a kick and since this had Jalapeno in it I was assuming it was hot...not so much. If you eat mildly hot foods this shouldn't bother you at all and definitely not if you like hot kind of food. I didn't even find them hot just have a unique kick of cheddery Jalapeno flavor. I would recommend to buy these at your local store if they carry them because this price on here is just insane, i buy mine for a little over 3 dollars for this bag. Overall I hope they decide to keep this one, cause they are amazing. And yes girls like these kind of snacks too :)! Love!	0	0
1	B0083QJU72	A2E1PZP48JQMDE	sooooooooooo good!!!	this maple syrup is so rich in flavor-this is truly grade B maple syrup<br />the price is much better than in a specialty grocery store as well<br />the texture thickens in consistency if you keep it refrigerated, but once you leave it at room temperature it's a bit runny but still really delicious.<br />this grade of maple syrup tends to have such a richer flavor-it's like regular grade A times 4 in flavor but without the extra sugar.<br />it's still a bit pricey for some, but very worth it, you'll notice you won't need need to use a lot at one sitting as well because the flavor is so rich.	0	0
1	B0016BFR4G	A3B1HFF2NIOUA7	Great Green Tea at a Great Price	Uncle Lee's Green Tea is about on par with Tazo Green Tea.  They are the two best green teas I've had.  I agree with the other reviewer that it isn't bitter or stale like many green teas.<br /><br />I gave some to my mother and it has quickly become her favorite.  Now she knows that there are differences in teas.  She won't go back to Lipton and other big names.  Tazo green tea might just edge it out, but Uncle Lee's is considerably less expensive.	2	0

1	B000PDY3P0	A3MLF5UTXISQ5I	Popcorn anyone?	I will not be trying any other popcorn for as long I can get this from Amazon. The 4oz portion pack is perfect for our whirleypop and the popcorn is great.  As I have read in other reviews the oil can be solid while in the package, but once you put it to the heat it melts fast.  We have had a couple packages that had a few extra unpopped kernels, but no more than any other brand we have tried and with the subscibe and save price you can not beat the price.	2	0
-1	B003XUJ564	AWZVOA3KLY7UU	Almost half of cans damaged	I saw that some folks had problems with damaged cans but many more gave good reviews so I took the risk.  Turns out that 5 out of the 12 cans were dented...and I mean severely dented.  And those were all packed in the center of the shrink wrapped flat so as to hide the dents unless the can was unpacked.  I haven't tried the good product; I'm sure it's fine tasting since I like Chef Boyardee products.  I am very disappointed in Amazon's attempt to hide the damaged cans though.  There is no way those cans were damaged in shipping...the box was perfect.  This was deliberate concealment of damaged goods.	5	0
1	B003H26J5I	A2RH5970FA8I2R	Closest thing to pasta yet	I heard about these through Hungry-girl.com and am so glad I tried them.  I kept hearing how I should replace pasta with spaghetti squash and found the texture and taste to be unsatisfying.  Although these need to be rinsed well and patted thoroughly dry, I think these are the closest thing to real pasta at about 10% of the calories.  I have tried the fettuccine and the macaroni, both which I like, but the angel hair shape is the best.  Works great with the Hungry-girl recipe on the back too.  YUM!  I highly recommend.  The seller also sent these to me so quickly and at no additional shipping price for my multiple orders.	0	0

1	B001FXLLEK	A2DB720I9XRX7K	Great-tasting, all natural cereal	Kay's French Vanilla Protein Cereal is a good tasting way to get gluten-free cereal with lots of soy protein.

1	B005C3IVN8	A3RM73SGBNVFH6	Delicious	I grew up eating pancakes with real maple syrup, and the fake HFCS-based syrup just doesn't compare. Maple syrup is just wonderful with breakfast or as a sweetener in cooking. I had never had grade B maple syrup but recently decided to try it because it's a few dollars cheaper. Turns out I love it just as much if not more than the grade A syrup I was used to. It's not graded by quality like some foods, but rather by the color. Grade B is darker and has a stronger flavor. If you like one you'll like the other, and you'll like this Anderson's maple syrup. With Amazon's subscribe and save it's a much better deal than buying at my grocery store.	6	0

1	B003LE6PL0	A3GIMXLOEPFJBV	Budding flowers arrived on time	I pre-ordered this product from ProFlowers through Amazon two weeks ahead of Mother's Day and was quite happy when it showed up today on the scheduled date. It was delivered by FedEx. The flowers were slightly wilted from being out of water for the 12-24 hours they were in transit but they perked right up after being put in water.  Included in this package was a nice vase and 2 packets of plant food.<br /><br />Keep in mind these are mostly buds and will take a day or two to fully open so you might want to have them delivered slightly in advance like I did.<br /><br />The only possible negative I can think of is the fact I was not provided a tracking number by email to track the package, but it did arrive on time and in good condition.	0	0

1	B000Z978SS	A1SO1PGDNVMLXC	Great product!  From corn, not birch	Erythritol tastes like sugar, just like xylitol.  It is not, however, toxic to pets as xylitol is.  Also, it does not have the gastrointestinal effects (bloating, gas, etc.) that can come with intake of large quantities, as is the case with xylitol.  Both are quite safe for people, however.  Dogs cannot eat chocolate, either, due to toxicity, so xylitol is just another thing that works for us but not for them.  But erythritol is safe for both people and animals.<br /><br />The downside to erythritol is that it costs more than xylitol and is only 70% as sweet as sugar, whereas xylitol is closer to being the same sweetness as sugar.<br /><br />I haven't had much luck baking with either of them -- but maybe others have had different experiences.<br /><br />Both xylitol and erythritol taste great - I can't tell them from sugar.  Stevia is also a healthy sugar alternative, but it definitely has a taste -- not pleasant in large amounts (bitter).<br /><br />Not all brands of xylitol and erythritol are equal.  Many come from birch trees which often is extracted using sulfuric acid.  The ones from NOW Foods are from corn, which does not require sulfuric acid.<br /><br />This is a good company and I have been very happy with them.  On the other hand, I did not have a good experience with Emerald Forest's products or customer service.  Their products come from birch trees and have a very unpleasant odor.  I much preferred the products from this company - they taste great and don't really have an odor.	15	2

For those of you who don't know - the Keurig ""K-cup"" coffee maker uses these little cup-packets of coffee grounds to make individual servings of coffee.<br />~<br />I recently bought the part for my coffee maker that allows you to brew your own ground coffee, such as this. I've used it several times, but the coffee always comes out watery or bitter.  I was hesitant to try this brand but let me tell you - it's AWESOME.<br />~<br />This coffee is now my new favorite one to make at home. I've had it several times now and it's always consistently awesome.  A nice bold flavor without being bitter or watery.  It's the ultimate coffee - a nice solid smooth coffee flavor without any harshness or tart aftertaste.  I highly recommend this one for any Keurig Coffee Maker users out there!!!!"	1	0

1	B000PWMHW2	ANKISKS44UFIJ	One of my most favorite places on earth	I love The Meadow.  So I guess this review is more about how much I adore this store, than it is about the salt (which by the way is fabulous).  I got my order way faster than I expected, which was nice.  I would recommend purchasing anything from these amazing folks, and even better if you can visit their lovely store in Portland.  This is one of the most romantic stores that exists.  Opening my box of truffle salt, and smelling that fragrant scent, was just not as magical as walking into their gorgeous store filled with flowers, salt, chocolate and wine.  Ah, it is a taste of heaven.<br /><br />The salt's great.  thanks Meadow people.	2	0

1	B000GQTP1S	A3KJE2P41Z0ECS	WOW...	I rarely do product reviews on Amazon BUT after having the 1st bag I knew I had to say something!<br /><br />These chips are not for the faint. They have a wonderful kettle cooked crunch to them and the bag size is the perfect munching snack to watching a movie.  These are not only going to make a good snack for me (as I really like spicy foods) but will also make the perfect laugh when I let friends try them...<br /><br />These chips have a wonderful flavor and not too much spice (if any at all) when you first chomp into a them, but wait for it, after 5-10 second the burn starts to come usually about the time you reach for your second or third and by then it is too late.<br /><br />The burn lasts for a solid 10-15 minutes after eating a few handfuls and personally made me sweat a good deal as I finished off my first bag while watching a movie.<br /><br />These I would easily buy again and recommend them to ANYONE who wants a good laugh at someone else's expense OR of you really like painfully spicy hot sauce. Although they were a good deal spicier than I expected. If you know Blair's they are know for the very hottest of hot sauces and NOW I think they can also brag they have the hotest snacks!	0	0

1	B007M83302	A1PAGHECG401K1	ADDICTIVE	After years of being addicted to Smart Puffs, as soon as I tried these Sea Salt & Vinegar chips, I was an instant convert.<br /><br />They are light, crispy, and perfectly salty and vinegar-y.<br /><br />I think they taste amazing, however, my husband can't eat these chips because they make his eyes water. I *love* vinegar (I could drink the stuff if it wouldn't kill my stomach) so I don't understand how he's not obsessed with these chips (he likes the BBQ the best...). I guess if you're sensitive to vinegar-y tastes, this may not be the chip to you.<br /><br />However, if you LOVE Vinegar, like I do, these chips will pretty much take over your life as your favorite food. I sneak them all day. And they aren't terribly bad for you (12 grams of fat in a large bag), so if you overindulge, you won't have to add an extra mile to your workout the next day. However, you will get a raw tongue.<br /><br />My only complaint is that some of the bags are a little overcooked, and the chips are a light brown instead of golden colored. But they still taste the same, and are far and above any other Salt-and-Vinegar chip I have ever tried, including the ones that are terribly bad for you.	2	0

After the ingredients change I have not noticed any sort of change in my siberian huskies what so ever. They still have high energy, very lush coats,white teeth and great done density.

1	B0081XIA1E	A1Y52YHV1P7HF4	I'm Amazed	I was really skeptical as to whether my Jack Russell Terrier would even bother with this type of toy. But I put it down for her the day I got it and she spent a good 45 minutes playing with it, retrieving the food, and me refilling so she could play some more. That's an incredible length of time for her to spend on one activity. I'll be getting some more toys like this I think.	1	0
1	B001AQS7JE	A10J4L673JCW9X	Really nice flavor	I just picked these up at random at my local Asian market, and I am really impressed. I'd drive the 15-20 minutes there again just to pick these up. They have an excellent coffee flavor and aren't horribly sweet like most hard candies. Each candy is individually wrapped and lasts a good long time.	2	0

They are dry, so I recommend eating them alongside salads, or having a glass of water handy.  I love them.	7	0

I'm definately buying these again.	0	0
1	B001ZSF9EI	A30KIP8VOIACNI	Only treats our cats will eat!	We have a very picky cat. He turns his nose up to well-loved kitty delights such as Fancy Feast, Friskies, or anything too low-brow for his tastes. He LOVES these treats, which says a lot. You never can predict what your cat's taste buds will enjoy, but I'd recommend these treats on the basis that a) a picky kitty likes them; and b) they don't stink to high hell.	0	0

-1	B0015R9BQG	A1J1WODSG2NFCG	made in Taiwan?	I bought this without realizing that it is a product of Taiwan.  Considering all the health risks from eating foods made in China, I don't think I can trust the ingredients used in this product.  As I understand, Taiwan, Japan, and Korea, all import many food ingredients from China, and they have found many harmful chemicals in them (I am not even including those that are unsanitary, i.e. made from sewer water).  So what guarantee is there that this product do not contain carcinogens or other harmful chemicals?  FDA do not, and cannot, test every single foreign product coming into U.S.<br /><br />Eat at your own risk.	0	5

1	B004ASGJ5S	A3UCN2RGY7O6S1	Love it--and allergen free	This is one of the few canned sauces without citric acid. Their canned ground tomatoes I use all the time for sauce, better than imported San Marzano, and I am an Italian-American.  I know my sauce.  This can be found in some local supermarkets, here in NY it is in ShopRite, BestYet, and in larger cans at Sam's Club for under $4 for a HUGE 6 lb. can! In supermarkets, I bought it recently at $1 for a 15 oz. can on sale, regularly priced under $2 for a 15 oz. can.  Look for it and try it. Nice and thick and tasty as it should be.  An additional bonus for me personally is that it contains no food allergens such as dairy, eggs, or nuts.  Safe for my granddaughter who is allergic.	3	0

1	B00390T5JA	A2TJG4N8LNJW23	We really couldn't be happier and now our Cusinart is in retirement...	"My boyfriend and I received the Keurig Elite brewer as a Christmas gift after lusting after the brewers all of my friends and family owned.  We have been using a trusty Cuisinart 10-cup drip brewer for a couple of years now, and while it has served us well, it was a challenge to get a consistent cup of coffee.  Somehow we always ended up on either the too-strong or two-weak side of the line, despite our best efforts to be consistent.<br /><br />I should mention that we are students living on a very strict budget and we knew that the Keurig would end up being a little bit more costly than our Cuisinart.  But we really liked the idea of brewing coffee a cup at a time and cutting down on waste.  Thankfully, my generous sister surprised us with one for Christmas and it has really turned out to be a perfect gift!<br /><br />WARNING!<br /><br />I feel it is important to mention that we almost sent this back.  Considering how I've been singing its praises, I'm sure this is surprising, but there is something that ALL new Keurig owners should be made aware of.  The first maybe six or so cups aren't going to taste quite right.  Apparently this is a common problem.  There is a sort of plastic-y taste going on, even with coffees that don't normally have that fake finish.  It's the newness of the brewer.  Run five cups of straight water through it and then one cup of white vinegar to get rid of this problem.  I can't imagine how many people must have received one of these and then written it off immediately because of this issue.  It's a quick fix and a one-time deal, so be aware of that ahead of time.<br /><br />Now... as I was saying:<br /><br />The Keurig Elite is the entry level of the full size brewers (Keurig also makes a Mini, but we have friends who have had problems with that model).  It has a great water carafe that only needs to be refilled once every six cups (convenient!).  There is no digital display unlike some of the higher end models, but we don't find that a problem.  For those wanting to set up brew times in advance, though, that might be a make-or-break feature.  We manage just fine without it in our household.  It has the two cup sizes and, although they are only two ounces apart in size, the difference between the two can be quite dramatic.  I like a milder cup of coffee while my boyfriend prefers something stronger so I brew on the larger size while he picks the more potent smaller for his cup.<br /><br />When we turn the power on in the morning it takes about 3 minutes for the brewer to heat up and then it really truly does brew the cup in less than a minute.  SO convenient when you want to make a quick cup on your way out the door!  No muss, no fuss.<br /><br />We tried out several pods from the 12 k-cup sample pack the brewer came with (another bonus!) and since then we've also tried out a few of Keurig's other offerings.  It's really hit-and-miss in terms of what you'll like and what will be positively NOT your cup of coffee.  Here are some of the blends we have tried and enjoyed:<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00474OR8G"">Caribou Coffee, Caribou Blend, K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count</a> - Our standard go-to good cup of coffee.  Nothing fancy or amazing, but consistently good flavor.  You can't go wrong with this medium roast.<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003JA5KLM"">Green Mountain Coffee Nantucket Blend, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)</a> - An alternative to the Caribou Blend that might be easier to find in most stores.  One of the few Green Mountain cups that I've tried and enjoyed.<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005IPJTZE"">Swiss miss Hot Cocoa K-Cup, Milk Chocolate, 12-Count</a> - The only hot chocolate k-cup we've tried and enjoyed so far.  It is artificially sweetened and you can tell that immediately, but it isn't weak or watery and definitely gets the job done.  Tip: shake the pod before you put it in the machine to loosen the powder.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like about the Keurig and its pod system, however, is that the pods are wasteful and non-recyclable.  Very disappointing.  Keurig is reportedly working on making a recyclable pod, but until that comes out I feel a bit guilty about going through the pods so quickly.  However, there is a solution to this problem!  We picked up the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051SU0OW"">ekobrew Cup, Refillable Cup For Keurig K-Cup Brewers, Brown, 1-Count</a> to use with our brewer!  And it has been perfect!  I'm Canadian so every time I visit home I pick up a big drum of Tim Horton's coffee (the best cheap coffee money can buy) and I can still use it in this little reuseable k cup.  Some reviewers had said that the ekobrew doesn't work with all Keurig models but I can attest to the fact that it works perfectly with the Elite brewer.  Apparently it is leaps and bounds better than Keurig's own reuseable My K Cup pod.  It's definitely worth the $10!<br /><br />Honestly, you really can't go wrong with the Keurig Elite.  We love it as a one-cup brewer without all the bells and whistles and we can't wait to try out the new pods we're set to receive from the included buy 2 get 2 free promotion through Keurig's website."	1	1
-1	B001X7RGCY	A1SP86X6K2DYHD	Smells of perfume or has an added 'scent'	I would not purchase this item again.  It has some sort of scent or perfume added which is not only very noticeable but unappetizing. No listing of any additive of that sort on the package except aromatic spices and I doubt there is anything in nature that smells like that. Packages are marked 'Product of China'.

-1	B00141UC9I	A2DFX17P9VGZNV	Caused diarrhea in one dog, vomiting in the other	I honestly don't know how this product could have garnered so many five-star reviews. I bought it for my senior dogs (14 years old) when their usual joint treats (Pet Naturals of Vermont soft chews) were out of stock, since one of my dogs is very finicky about what glucosamine supplements he'll take, and I had tried everything else available without success. I gave both of them the recommended dosage, based on their weights (15 and 24 lbs), and was delighted to see that they happily accepted the treats.  Within 12 hours, though, my Yorkie had raging diarrhea and my Eskie-poo had vomited forcefully, which was very unusual for both of them. Not realizing it was this product, I tried it again a couple of days after nursing them back to health, with the exact same effect. Internet searches confirmed that other users have similarly reported nasty GI side effects with this product.	3	2

1	B008ZRKZSM	AWJ1HL1NB63F2	PB2 terrific for Weight Watchers	I have been on Weight Watchers since June 24th of this year and have successfully lost 35 lbs. The one thing I missed was peanut butter!! It is very costly on the weight loss system that Weight Watchers established, Points Plus. When I saw it on Dr Phil's show, I was curious, ordered it and was I HAPPY. Mixing it with water, the recommended serving is 1 point, regular peanut butter can be as much as 5 points. When using sugar free jam or syrup to mix the powder in, the taste is wonderful and has the consistency of peanut butter, thanks to whom ever developed this product,for someone like myself, trying to get healthier,well this is just a blessing. I encourage anyone who is a peanut butter lover like me, and would like to have the taste without all of the fat and calories, GO FOR IT.	2	0
1	B0013NUGDE	ASYVOZ7GO4RIS	Tasty	I love Popchips. They are a lot different than regular potato chips, but they are quite good. Sea Salt and Vinegar and Chili Lime are my two favorite flavors, and I'd like to try Parmesan Garlic one day (they don't seem to be sold in my area for some reason). Popchips are lower in calories and fat than most regular potato chips, which makes them a healthier alternative when you're looking for something crunchy to snack on. I like to take them to movies (in those rare theatres that don't have 'no outside food' signs) to eat in lieu of butter-laden popcorn. If you're on the fence about buying these, I would recommend trying a small bag to see if you like them before buying one of these big multi-pack deals. I've seen them at a lot of grocery stores--that's where I buy mine. They really are quite different from regular potato chips, but they're tasty and definitely worth trying.	0	0

I have been giving them to her everyday for about a month and just last weekend she racied me down the stairs outside!!!  And she won!!! I really think these are helping her, so I'm on ""Subscribe and Save"" and will keep giving them to her forever if it keeps her out of pain. I also give one to my yorkie.

And at about .77/ea pack, a great deal too. I honestly have no reason to go to the theater any more! With this popcorn and the theater size candy packs available cheap at the grocery store/Wal-Mart, a case of pop and you are there for pennies on the dollar! Oh, the best part, used a plain old dutch oven on the stove top to pop the corn and it came out perfect. Literally, the BEST popcorn I have ever made, hands down.	0	0

I try to get it at Wal-mart, because there it is $.94 cents a box, 8 packets per box, and it is sugar free. Compared to Crystal Light that have 10 per box at $1.50 and not all are sugar free.

We went through just about every limited ingredient food to find one he would eat consistently.  He finally settled on Nature's Variety Instinct. Lamb and Rabbit he'll eat every time and all the time. Duck and Venison, he'll also eat just not always.<br /><br />He still suffers from IBD and will have pancreatitis flare ups if given chicken, but his coat is soft and shiny. He's active (at 13 yrs old). And he rarely throws up. I couldn't survive, he couldn't survive, without this food.<br /><br />I'm glad the company finally started to make 3 oz cans. Mr. Picky doesn't doesn't like leftovers. It doesn't hurt as much to toss out 1.5 oz as it does 4 oz.	1	0

1	B00112K2MC	A1I7JTPVAVBD5R	Good to mix, boosts immune system	"My pediatrician sent me on an online hunt for immune boosters for my son's diet when he contracted mono at age six--specifically for this product among a few others.  After ordering it and trying it out as chocolate milk, we found we actually preferred it as a ""mix-in"" type of powder rather than stand alone chocolate milk.  It worked mixed with milk, but turns pretty greenish after a few minutes and that was a visual turn-off for my six year old and for me to be honest.  Mixed in with pudding, yogurt, oatmeal (Mom was a huge hit the morning I had the chocolate oatmeal a-ha moment) and to make chocolate peanut butter banana smoothies, it has become a daily staple in our home.  We also use the fruit flavored mixed with greek vanilla yogurt and smoothies--it tastes sweeter to me, and is the second favorite.  Just a heads up for Mom's who may not be aware of what these super concentrated dark veggies and berries will do upon exit...don't panic when you see the end result in the toilet as unusually dark."	16	0

They got right into them, but you must supervise as the knobby ends break off and they are about the size of a large marble so could cause some trouble.  I also noticed they splintered, so they were removed at that point. I like the idea, but the safety issue was a problem.	4	1
-1	B008ZRKZSM	A2661Y23D6MPG6	Stinky peanut goo.	Consistency - good.<br />Value - bad.<br />Taste - not good, but bearable.<br />Smell - awful.<br /><br />I think I'll try the natural PB rather than resort to this expensive, stinky, messy powder.  If it were cheap, maybe I'd force myself to eat it, but there's no way I'm paying a premium for this stuff.  I am trying to find ways to cut back on fat & calories, but this isn't going to be it.  I was actually surprised at how bad I thought it was considering all the glowing reviews.	5	1
1	B000FBM3YK	ARM30MN576O9M	Best cookies in the world	These cookies are fabulous. Flaky, not too sweet, fluffy not gooey layers. Small but not too small. Suggested serving size of 6 is good. Lots of things these days have completely unrealistic serving sizes. I know they have sat fat but I really don't care. I have been unable to find anything like them. They remind me of REAL bakery cookies.	2	0

-1	B000YSS7EO	A2PMT0G1LRUH6Z	Sad that sugar is added unlike the rice or oatmeal HAPPYBELLIES	My son LOVES HappyBellies Oatmeal, so I tried the Multigrain and he loved it, too. So did I, until I read the ingredients and noticed that they added glucose to make the cereal sweet. No extra sugar for my darling. Back to the oatmeal version for us since it's naturally sweet. As he's now 10 months old, I'm exposing him to other grains, like quinoa (which is in the multigrain)and complementing his daily grains with the HB oatmeal to get all those good vitamins and probiotics and DHA.	1	0

1	B001LGGH40	A1TRAEV7QWA5DX	Great for a cabonated drink	I seldom drink carbonated beverages, but tried the Kiwi Berry since it sounded interesting and had no added sweeteners or preservatives.<br /><br />I was sure surprised by the very light carbonation, which I enjoyed, plus the taste was really, really good.  It is not too sweet and has a very nice, fruity taste.  I more or less expected something along the lines of a flavored  Pepsi or a Coke.<br /><br />I think the size of the can is just right for me.  I would not want something larger.  I believe it has a few more calories than a Coke, but the flavor is very refreshing and if I had my choice, I would drink the Switch drinks especially the Kiwi Berry.	0	0

1	B0045XE32E	A27X7XXOKMK879	Unattractive but Terrific Treat For Pets	The Newman's Own Organics Ranch Style Dog Treats are pretty plain - a brown rectangle (the kids call them ugly), compared to the other dog treats we've purchased at the supermarket.  But the real consumer of this product are the dogs and they love them.  We have two large mixed breeds and one is more finicky than the other (think of them as the Oscar and Felix of the dog world) and they both enjoy these treats (though the treats are small for 60+ pound dogs).  The treats are sized for medium sized dogs (you can always give bigger dogs two) and the nice feature that I like is they come in a rectangle that has a line division down the middle that can be used to break the treat in half if you have a smaller dog.  So while, they won't be winning any awards for attractiveness, they are organic without unneeded additives and the dogs appreciate them as a reward for a job well done or just a treat for being the wonderful pets that they are.	0	1

It tastes more like ginger ale then an orange drink. I have tried a bunch of flavors but this one is my favorite and it's easy to find elsewhere like publix, vitamin shoppe, and costco... however amazon.com has the best prices! I have tried to workout in the morning without having one and my performance/energy is literally nonexistent. For beachbody workouts like Insanity, Chalean Extreme and now I'm doing TurboFire this is a great energy drink to have that only has 10 calories and no sugar/aspartame. I also like to have one in the afternoon if I need a pick-me-up. I keep wondering if it is too good to be true- I highly recommend!"	0	0

1	B000EM8KZ6	AQ5DOLCW77FEE	A bit different, and wonderful	These peppercorns are a beautiful rosy color, which clues you in before you even get a chance to open the package that they're not the peppercorns you've known all your life. When you do pull open the bag and inhale their aroma, you'll find they combine the scent of pepper with a wonderful fruity, almost floral overtone. It's hard to describe, and even harder to imagine until you've experienced it. The lovely part is that the flavor profile doesn't diminish in use; when I ground and steeped these Sichuan peppercorns for a dark chocolate mousse (grind finely, and steep in the heavy cream for 30 minutes before straining the cream into the chocolate) their vibrant peppery fruit/floral scent was the top note of the mousse. It was a memorably different flavor. Now I'm looking for ways to add them to more dishes, to see what new nuances they can impart to old favorites.	17	0

1	B007M83302	A1BCJRK9AO9GAX	Healthier alternative for chip fix	"In the last 8 years or so, there's been a potato chip Renaissance in the US.  I hadn't eaten potato chips in years, as the taste vs. unhealthy comparison always came up negative.  With the introduction of Kettle Chips brand and widespread availibity of them and Route 11, and competition from the big manfacturers, the chip bar has been raised.  However, they haven't gotten any healthier, so I try to keep them still as a ""sometimes"" snack.<br /><br />I'd seen Popchips in the store, and had wondered if they were any good, but never made the plunge.  Amazon was offering them at a discount price, and with the other reviews adding to my curiosity, I went for it...and was happy with the results.<br /><br />Popchips have a different texture than traditional potato chips.  They are a bit fluffier with more thickness.  I'd put the texture somewhere between Munchos and a mini-rice cake.  However, they still have a satisfying potato chip crunch and potato flavor.  I am typically a salt & vinegar chip fan, but in the case of Popchips, the BBQ is the real standout.  The BBQ flavor is the perfect mix of sweet and spicy, with just a little bit of tanginess.  Every friend who we've introduced to them has been pleasantly surprised and gone off to buy their own.<br /><br />If the health factor wasn't part of the equation - would I choose Popchips over Kettle Brand?  For most varieties, its probably a no - potato chips still have a great crunch that's hard to give up.  But for BBQ, I think that Popchips has it nailed - their flavor is better than any other BBQ chip I've had, so they come out on top.  And at considerably less calories and fat - it's a no brainer."	0	0

The only issue I have is that most of the treats are a bit big and difficult to break into smaller pieces which is necessary for obedience classes where we go through many treats.  Therefore, I do not use these treats for that purpose.  (The container recommends only 3-4 cubes per day for large dogs).

1	B0013NUGDE	A10PY7J8JMTP7Q	"""Un-sinfully"" Lip Smackin' Good"	Love these pop-chips.  I've tried some other flavors too but found salt and pepper the best so far.  Original comes a close second for me.  Salt and vinegar is a very close third. Garlic is too strong for me (I love garlic in other forms though).<br /><br />I was hesitant to try these initially because I'm not a big fan of pepper flavor in chips, but am I glad I did!  The pepper flavor rounds up the chip rather than defines it, so it doesn't feel like you're eating pepper in it's raw form.<br /><br />It's a good thing the fat content is low because these are quite addictive.	1	0

I tried them many times and simply could not get the same pasta-eating experience.  I eat half the box at a time, which is about 4 ozs, and it's so filling I can't eat more if I wanted. It keeps me satiated all night. I don't even get the urge to snack. This is like a miracle to me.  Even my children who are the absolute pickiest eaters in the world love this pasta and will eat it in substitute for the ""real"" (and unhealthy) alternative. The other reviews are absolutely correct in that you should cook it 2 - 5 minutes longer than you would cook other pasta or even what the box says.

1	B0047E2I5U	AVMDL6UUCOO4X	8 month Shih Tzu loves VENISON!!!	I guess my little pup went through what can be typical for the Shih Tzu breed to be a finicky eater.  He began walking away from his water moistened dry food: Blue Buffalo puppy, Nutro, Merrick (all of the same flavors).  I got this as my cousin had sent me some venison jerky she makes for her Yorkie's and they love it.  I put half the serving size bowl of this down for my little Weston and he lapped it up, looking up at me lovingly for more.  I gave him the rest of the serving size and he galloped away with more energy (even MORE than he normally showed) and played hard, napped and his eliminations were smaller and neater to clean up.  It seems that he is getting more nourished and retaining the nutrients he needs.  His coat is even more soft and supple.  This is a great product to take on trips without any mess or extra bowls, etc to pack.  Thanks, ZiwiPeak!!!!	0	0

It's mild, it's not overly bold, it's nice and mellow, it's not bitter in the least, it's not watery, it's PERFECT.  I like my coffee with milk and sugar and this one is just the BEST.

1	B005HGOIQ4	A2HYHT45PHNIIG	A Qualified 5	Just want to note my initial impressions.  I usually use sugar at home only for beverages and cereal.  I was running low on the 'raw sugar' I bought a few months back, and was looking for some more, when I ran into this.  For the price, it was worth a try.<br /><br />When I opened the package and caught the first sniff of the product, the first thought that came into my head was 'grape nuts'.  Odd, but that's what it made me think of.  The flavor is acceptable, no coconut that I could discern.  I agree that it doesn't seem quite as sweet as regular sugar.  It dissolves well in my coffee, but I haven't tried it on cereal yet.  I like the fact that it provides some nutritional value as well as sweetness.<br /><br />So, my 5 rating is qualified only by the fact that it is less sweet than I am used to.  I'm going to try using the same amount as I would if I were using 'regular' sugar and see if it's something I can get used to.  I could stand to become a little less dependent on sweetness.	3	0

And what makes it a sweeter deal you get 3 packs for the typical price of 1 K-Cup box, take note it's a Pack of 3, so a total of 36 k-cups.<br /><br />I suggest only using the small cup setting to prevent it from being watered down too much, but decide for yourself!	4	0
1	B000RZAJL8	A2S3Z54BI73QIK	Great lean snack - ostrich!	These meat snacks are fabulous and incredibly healthy.  I first discovered them at my health club in New Hampshire, where they charge $2.50 for one stick, so buying them from Amazon made sense, cutting the cost by a buck.  Try all the flavors - they're all great, and very low in fat with lots of fiber.  Highly recommend.	3	0
1	B0058AMY74	A2BLJGGWN8GTXQ	Salty and vinegary!!!	These are the strongest tasting salt and vinegar chips I've had.  I could still do with more vinegar flavor, but I think this is as close as I'm going to get without dousing them with vinegar powder myself.<br /><br />I did a side by side with the Cape Cod salt and vinegar and these are about twice as flavorful.  Additionally, as other reviewers have said, they have quite a good bit of potassium in them (somewhere in the neighbor of 15% RDA per serving).	0	0

(Those jugs are great, even better if you can still find them half price at Costco.)<br /><br />I'm glad I ordered this when I did, the price has more than doubled! I'd still say it's a GREAT value. This is my go to tea when I want something with a little more flavor than ""regular"" black tea. I don't sweeten my tea, but I think this would be a perfect sweet tea for a hot day. The orange flavor is very palatable unlike some others. It's noticeable without being pungent or artificial. It also isn't spiced like many other orange teas."	1	0

My daughter loved it; I loved the fact that she was getting good protein. Most of the other earth's best baby foods have carrot/squash/sweet potatoes, which is fine, however my daughter was turning orange from so many orange veggies. I liked that this one had NO orange veggies in the ingredient list. Slightly more expensive than other meals, which I think is due to the fact it has a lot of meat in it.	0	0

The flavor is a very light coconut and the coffee is a medium body.  I must admit that I was a little hesitant about a ""coconut"" flavor.  DON'T BE!

My favorite coffee is Caribou, but this is not far behind.  I followed the instructions exactly, using two teaspoons per 6oz of water.  I have a coffee maker where you put the beans in one side, and the water in the other, and press a button. . .  so measuring ground coffee is not my thing, but this worked great.  I didn't have a problem using it in my non-Melitta coffee maker at all.  Very enjoyable.  .. rich flavor. . . smooth. . . What's not to like? ;-)	0	0

So far I have only tried (and intend to try) the Key Lime Pie and the Mint Chocolate Chip but they are both amazing.  They key lime pie is incredibly tart and delicious but unfortunately the flavor only lasts about 10 seconds.  The Mint Chocolate Chip is also incredible and the flavor seems to last much longer (or at least, the dulled post-flavor gum is more appealing).  In any event, even for 5 seconds of flavor these gums are a gem.  Great idea by Wrigley.	6	0

1	B004ZIER34	A3E7YWI8VV7VCV	Delightfully Surprising & Smooth	While I don't normally go for dark roasted coffees, the Puroast Low Acid French Roast coffee was astonishingly appealing. The lack of bitterness and bite actually enhanced the rich nutty flavor. I sampled this product both with cream and without cream and found both methods quite enjoyable. I generally get a stomach cramp within a few moments of drinking coffee, but it was conspicuously absent when drinking this brand. I can only conclude that the low acid is the reason for the change. Additionally the low acid nature of the beverage made it more smooth on the palate.<br /><br />The price of the coffee may deter many coffee drinkers, but for those with a sensitivity to acid and a refined taste for quality coffee the price is worth the added benefits. In comparison, Starbucks French Roast is offered in a 36 ounce package of ground coffee for slightly more than Puroast is offering their 40 ounce package of whole beans.<br /><br />Keep in mind that Puroast also offers a variety of other flavors including half caff and decaf flavors. Additionally Puroast offers a membership program that reduces the price when the consumer agrees to have the product placed on a regular shipping schedule. When drinking coffee is a regular part of your life, auto shipments seem like a good idea and low acid even more so.	0	0

1	B000LKVDUU	AUY3W255E6M1C	Surprisingly Delicious	I usually have pretty low expectations for boxed dinners, but this dish certainly was surprisingly full of flavor. There was plenty of spice, so I wouldn't recommend it for someone who is not a fan of hot, spicy food, but if you are buying food from this region, it's probably to be expected (the description calls it mildly spicy). The vegetables dominate the mixture, which was very easy to prepare, even in the microwave. Despite what the box says, you get one nice-sized serving per package. Considering this isn't a dish most would be likely to make on their own, it's a nice cullinary departure and worth a try.	2	0
-1	B002DLXXHG	A1G9RXN4S5D9WO	Decent at best	This Jerky is close, but not quite as good as good as other pre-packaged bags you can get at the gas station.  It's tender and substantial, so points there.  The flavor though is mediocre at best; poor would be a fair description.<br /><br />Also, if you open the bag it will grow mold in a few days.  Maybe this is a problem with other brands of jerky too.  I wouldn't know because this is the first time I have opened a bag and not eaten it relatively quickly (see above's flavor comments).<br /><br />All in all, this isn't very good jerky.	0	0

I noticed a lot of the negative reviews were complaining about it not being plain coconut flour or having more carbs than they wanted.

1	B0007OPVYE	A2BWK43O33GQES	Lifesavers without the holes, and more flavors.	First came across Charms when my parents received one of those boxes of 1950's candies as a gift, most of which was nearly inedible, but Charms was one of the few things I tried which actually tasted good.  Essentially Charms is just like a Lifesaver (maybe they came before?) only better.  Instead of a circle with a hole in the middle they are squares with little indention's (they kind of look like Halls cough drops) so you get more candy for your buck.  They also have more flavors, off the top of my head in addition to the typical flavors there's green apple, orange, and strawberry (maybe a few more different ones). And the 3rd best thing, they're individually wrapped, which makes it easier to carry a few around in your pocket and insure they don't get dirty.  Really not sure why these things haven't aren't more popular, much better than Lifesavers in terms of pocket candy.	0	0
1	B00060PTLO	A26RY08HNRGTR	Quick and easy latte at home	I was introduced to this product a few years ago and was floored by how tasty and depending on the amount and type of milk added (2% or whole), how chocolaty the flavor could even be.  I've recently moved and don't know where to find it locally so I'm trying the online purchasing option - I'm almost out of it!<br /><br />This is a very nice option for those of us who don't drink coffee all that often but want to have something of quality in the kitchen cupboard.

1	B001LGGH40	A2OKRGHIYTBQ6P	It was pleasure to try.	Recently I had the pleasure of trying the Kiwi Berry flavor of Switch 100% fruit juice. It is unbelievable that a sugarless carbonated drink can taste so great and yet be good for you. The Kiwi Berry was bold and tangy instead of sweet and cloying. The carbonation made the drink sparkling and energetic. Since I have recently kicked my 15 year habit of drinking Diet Coke, I have been looking for a substitute drink that wasn't straight fruit juice or straight soda. As an American I have become accustomed to thinking that carbonated drinks are the fun ones and that merely being healthy by drinking juice is boring. So Switch allows me to feel healthy and have some fun at  the same time while also giving up caffeine which I really don't want during the day. If Switch comes out with additional flavors I will certainly try those as well.	0	0

Starbucks is more for people who work in an office and need a cup which says Starbucks on it.<br /><br />I combine this syrup with my favorite coffee of all time, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004868RJ8"">Douwe Egberts Aroma Rood Ground Coffee, 17.6-Ounce (Pack of 2)</a>  I warmed up a mug of Douwe Egberts and Torani Syrup in the microwave at work - what a mistake.  My co-workers reacted like they've never smelled hazelnut coffee before.  They gathered around me like zombies looking for coffee to feed on.  It was horrifying to see the aroma of hot coffee turn the office staff into monsters.  Someone shouted and organized a ""coffee run"" to the local doughnut shop to distract them while I escaped with my Torani hazelnut coffee.<br /><br />Now I keep my coffee warm in an insulated mug from home so I don't have to run the gauntlet to and from the cafeteria at work, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0043X3X7C"">Zojirushi DB50-BA Stainless Mug Black 17 oz/0.5 liter</a><br /><br />Always make sure that you keep some of this on-hand to fend off the coffee zombies!<br /><br />I put a splash into my insulated mug with some fat-free half 'n half and I'm set for the morning.  Just don't let aroma get loose.  Someone walking past my office asked, ""What's that wonderful smell?""  It was Torani."	4	0
1	B002FTLXYG	AJK58JRZ0Y63G	What a money saver	We own an Australian Shepard who WAS getting ear infections frequently and always scratching. This started about two years ago. I finally took her to a new vet, (my old vet NEVER mentioned food allergies, hmmmm). Vet said chronic ear infections are usually due to food allergies and that we could try their food at $100.00 a 20lb bag. YIKES! We found NL Lamaderm at Wal-mart. We noticed after just a few days that Sheila stopped scratching. Needless to say really, the change of food,(which, by the way, she gobbled up),caused really bad gas. But after a few weeks that stopped too. No ear infections, no scratching. We are thrilled with this product. We pay less than $25.00 for a 20lb bag at Wal-Mart. Thank you NLPP for providing us with the key to a healthier dog.	1	0
-1	B003XUJ564	A1NCD4RU28PX13	Dented Cans . . .	10 out of 12 cans are seriously dented , and, the dents did not occur during shipping. These were dented befor they were packed in the case of 12 at the factory. These will get trashed because it will be more of a pain to return them. I will never buy these again !!! Amazon did refund my money without having me return the cans. Cudos to Amazon. They are a class act!	4	7
1	B0014J9OTE	A3UZANZFE4N6PW	Delicious	I love B-Fresh cinnamon gum! It tastes great, it's good for you and it temporarily freshens your breath. Now the flavor doesn't last a long time but with 100 pieces you have plenty to chew on.	0	0

-1	B000EM6PC6	AIZL2LJ33BTHJ	foul tasting substance	"There are several types of teas in the world indian ceylon scented teas like jasmine, there's oolong, black green, but one thing binds all these teas together, they taste like tea.<br /><br />This substance has no flavor only an astringent quality.  It is not drinkable plain.  Which I suppose is why people require all sorts of recipes adding sugar, or spices, anything to give this tea some flavor and take away the horrid bitterness.<br /><br />I think it's even worse than the bagged lipton tea if that is possible.  In the bagged tea, they don't put dust in the teabags because it would fall right out of the bag, but since this is loose tea, lipton saw fit to add dust, twigs, anything but the actual leaves.<br /><br />What should you drink?  Anything you like.  I suggest browsing this site called the English Tea Store (no affiliation) just to get an idea about what types of teas it is possible to purchase.<br /><br />I astounds me that anyone could drink this substance and call it ""tea"".  It is not tea, it is particles of bitterness, dust, pieces of twigs, black and tasteless leavings of what used to be a tea plant.<br /><br />What the hell is wrong with you people, to drink this stuff.  By the way I have nothing against some lipton tea, but when you drink this stuff you need to add lemon, sugar, or cream, something because it is awful stuff trying to drink it on its own.<br /><br />If you have to buy tea at a supermarket, try the twinings darjeeling that's a decent blend you can drink."	3	3
1	B00016JH5M	A1Q46CLLJ2D4R0	A GENUINE TREAT	I had never cooked or baked with dried strawberries until I came across a recipe for granola that I had to try, and it called for dried strawberries.  I purchased a bag of these Barry Farm strawberries, and I was so amazed by their pure flavor and soft texture that I came back for more ... and more!  Barry Farm must choose berries at their peak of ripeness because the berries are rich in pure strawberry flavor with a perfect consistency. I am particular about the food I buy, and I want good quality.  Why bother to bake something with inferior ingredients?  I would highly recommend Barry Farm Dried Strawberries to anyone.  They are truly excellent.	1	2
1	B001P3NU30	A1IVQLHS24YYEY	"""treats"""	Our vet recommended these to help control tarted buildup.  Our dog absolutly loves them - I almost think they are addicting!  She only gets one a day and she makes sure we do not forget to give it to her.  They have seemed to help much more than just rawhide chews at keeping her teeth clean.	0	0
-1	B00139TT72	A31SM99AQNXDTG	I wish my dog liked it	Based on the great reviews from everyone about their picky dogs loving it and always eating it I figured my picky dog would enjoy it as well.  The price for the amount is also very good considering it is all organic but sadly my dog hates it..  She smells it and walks away and when i try to hide the food she finds her way to eat around this food.  I wont be buying it again but I really wished my dog enjoyed it so I could continue to support this brand.	1	1
-1	B006N3IG4K	A1AOCVNFLPJVUV	Really???	I'm amazed that people are happy with this product.  I'm not a drinker of the dark brews, French roast or anything, but even for a drinker of a milder cup of coffee, this is completely tasteless.  The initial scent is delicious, too bad none of it shows up in the actual coffee.	0	1
1	B001E5E20O	AOOU4GVVQHK5O	Great tea	Rishi's tea is great! Nice flavor, color and most importantly it is not super-caffeinated like many other Earl Grey teas, so one can enjoy a 'strong' brew. Their white tea is also fantastic. I only wish they would make an English Breakfast version.	0	0
1	B004K30HO2	ACDJDU3VK01QI	Great product	The pods worked as described.  I did not have overflows. I found the best way to secure the top is to press the raised area in the center of the top. Wish they were sold in larger quantities	1	0
1	B004LQESES	A221LCZT868MP8	Best of the Soda Stream flavors	Tastes almost exactly like Diet Dr. Pepper.  REALLY good.  We think this is the best flavor Soda Stream makes.  Also try the diet orange, its very good.	0	0

1	B0011FYQR6	A7V0SNZC8A10M	Bioneem works, if you follow the directions!	I used Bioneem to control small leafhoppers on my tomatoes and potatos.  If you follow the directions, spraying frequently, you will control them.  This is a safe way to treat certain insects, I would definitely buy this product again.	12	0
-1	B000HDMUQ2	A3SM576V5911MB	Not a Fan	Refer to the picture I posted above.  The bar is half the size you think it is going to be...It is literally a two-bite bar.  Very deceptive advertising.  That and the fact that they are ridiculously expensive is the reason for the one star.  My 10 year old son ate one and didn't like them. I ate one and agreed as did my husband.  Couldn't give it away!  Everyone has different tastes but these are no tasty treat as far as I'm concerned.	0	0
1	B0016PKA1C	A618BKNYH6AQC	just works	"My wife bought me this for storing fresh herbs and despite initial skepticism I gave it a try. It seemed to work well enough for basil, even freshening up some wilted leaves... but the ""seal the deal"" moment was when I put some fresh thyme in it and put it in the back of my refrigerator where I mostly forgot about it. 6 weeks later (we were gone for 2 weeks on vacation) I opened it and the thyme was as fresh as the day it was cut. I doubt it would sustain all greens for this long but the fact that it kept thyme fresh for over a month longer than a plastic bag in the produce drawer would have made this an easy $10 to justify.<br /><br />It's always a nice surprise when a kitchen gadget delivers the goods."	1	0

1	B000RJARJS	A2XS1KPMMSF6AM	Fantastic Tea	We love this tea.  Its the only tea my coffee drinking hubby likes.  We use a single mug type tea strainer since the tea is very fine ground.	1	0
1	B0045XE32E	A3DOPYDOS49I3T	Dog likes em'	These look like regular ole dog biscuits. They don't have a strong smell so you can hold these and the smell will not stay on you hands for a while like other treats. You can put these in your pocket and not worry about crumbling or smell in your pocket if you are taking your dog for a walk. We have a rottweiler and he eats anything you put in front of his face. What's great about these is that they are a lot better and healthier than other treats. Like others have said these are pretty hard. I tried breaking some that are stuck in half and it is pretty hard to do. So, sometimes our dog gets lucky with two treats.	1	2
1	B000RQPV1A	A8VLLXZJYUZHO	hard to find white pepper	I never look any place for the hard to find things be spices books etc. It seems I always can find it on Amazon.

1	B00016UX0K	A3GFVNB9R3XAL8	Put it over all meats	I love this stuff.  I put it over chicken and even steaks.  It's very sweet, and just a bit spicy.  Just a little goes a long way.	0	0
1	B005KDJEJK	A3490HC0ZWOS10	outstanding	recommended to me by a friend i saw at the gym - had seen them a few times at the fatted calf in napa, but didnt really pay attention.  i will never buy beans in the bag from the grocery store again.  huge difference in taste and quality.  sent my son who is an aspiring chef and gourmet foodie a box of beans in a bag as well...	6	1
-1	B001AJ1ULS	A88WK54WGJ15T	Good idea , but....made in China	Originally, these were made in US. Now made in China ( see back of bag) ... advertised as natural,cage free, no hormones, no fillers, no antibiotics ...HUH? Not in China... I will not trust these as safe treats. Follow up:  My dogs vomited after they ate these. 3/09 original warnings from FDA 2007 re: chicken product from China... a follow up was issued by the FDA again on 12/18/08 to remain vigilant and of concern if fed to smaller dogs.<br /><br />Update: DEC 2011 All chicken Jerky remains a problem according to the FDA (product from China noted again to be of concern)<br />Some dogs made ill from chicken jerky product recovered with treatment and others have died.<br />The email from my vet stated that the FDA would like you to report if you have a problem with chicken jerky treats.	149	6
1	B000KV61FC	A3QD0PL3REPWR8	Great for puppies	My white Germany Shepherd puppy is 5 months old and this toy keeps her occupied for hours on end. I recommend starting out with tiny treat bits to get your dog hooked at this game as it is more rewarding. As your dog gets a hang of it you can increase its difficulty by increasing treat size.	0	0
1	B000EH0RU2	A168VQN7ZESTEA	RiceSelect Royal Blend, Whole Grain Texmati Brown and Wild Rice with Soft Wheat and Rye Berries	This blend of rice, wheat berries, and rye berries is delicious.  I'm using it in soups, cassaroles, and by itself as a side dish. Usually, I put it in my rice cooker and in about 45 minutes it is ready to be eaten.  I plan to purchase more of this product.  I haven't found it in my local grocery stores, so it is wonderful to be able to order it, and have it arrive in just a few days in excellent condition.	2	0
1	B000E65OF6	A3T1O6VEKRUM0X	Flawless herbal tea	Sleepytime tea is one of those teas that can always be counted on. It's very mellow, with a great taste and smell. Perfect for relaxing after a long day. This is the tea that all other herbal teas should be measured against.	0	0

1	B001EQ5F9K	A22CW0ZHY3NJH8	The family's favorite cereal	This is one of my family's favorite cereals.  Even my son likes it, and that's saying a lot.  It's light and crunchy, full of cinnamon flavor with just a touch of sweetness.<br /><br />Low in fat and calories, sugar is not too bad in my book (that's always debatable depending on who you ask, but I don't think 8 grams per serving is horrible).  It even contains fiber and protein and 9 vitamins and minerals.<br /><br />We love this cereal for breakfast, or any time we need a quick on the go snack in a bag.<br /><br />per 3/4 cup serving:<br />Calories - 120<br />total fat - 1.5 grams<br />protein - 3 grams<br />fiber - 2 grams<br />sugars - 8 grams<br />total carbohydrate - 25 grams	5	0
1	B001397X3O	AUDQIJOG4JI87	Love these.....but a comment about last order.....	I recently (December '10) reordered these mints (I can't find them where I live, so I order them on a fairly regular basis) & it seems that something was missing in this batch.....the cinnamon flavor! So far, every roll has been nothing but sugar.....has anyone else had this 'problem'????<br /><br />  I first tried these a couple of months ago when I saw them at a Whole Foods store. I was instantly hooked! They are so good, I had to find a steady supply of them (I don't have a Whole Foods where I live) & was so glad Amazon.com had them. I have ordered them twice & they never last long-everyone that tries them loves them. I've tried the other mints that Newman's Own makes, but the Cinnamon mints are by far my favorite. I love the texture, the 'just-right' cinnamon flavor & the fact that I'm supporting a company that does so many good things.	0	0
1	B005K4Q1VI	A1M4IW1VQIMD83	Excellent Hot Chocolate	Having tried all the varieties of hot chocolate k-cups, Grove Square's are by far the best.  They are very chocolaty, rich, creamy, and leave very little sludge in the bottom of your cup.  Yum...	0	0

-1	B000Z978SS	A1FGCYTBMCJCB8	Didn't really like it....	I was so excited to receive this. Thought I would cut down on the calories. I didn't like the taste at all. We baked a banana bread and we threw it out. I am going to try again with brownies and add a little bit more. Maybe I just did not add enough. I thought it had an after taste though. I will still use it up and try once more.	5	3
1	B000SDMFC0	AMZCZBK1EF1PV	Great beans	I like the Lavazza Tierra! 100% Arabica Whole Bean Espresso Coffee a lot. I've tried a lot of beans. They are reliable, and have a round, pleasing flavor. Not burnt, not acidic. I like them more than the other Lavazza options in 2.2 lb bags.<br /><br />I use these beans with a superautomatic espresso machine. Nice crema. Nice flavor. The crema lasts for more than 5 minutes.	0	0

I love the size of this bag because it fills a candy dish that I have out completely with a few left over for me to eat up right away.  They last for a while - though not as long as they should - in my house, but I'll keep ordering them as they are a delicious treat.	0	0
