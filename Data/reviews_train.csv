1	B005K4Q1VI	A10E57QZ4GJ32F	keurig hot chocolate	great deal, especially for the price. Item arrived quicker than anticipated. This has saved me many trips to Dunkin Doniuts as well as saving me paying double the price for a cup of hot chocolate that's just as good. Looking for more to stockpile!	0	0
1	B000G6RYNE	A1LFB8KRBI9IE2	Eating them for years.	I found these more than 10 years ago in a health food store. After I bought one bag I found myself stopping by that store once a week to get these chips. The New York Cheddar flavor is so good, you will have a hard time not eating a whole bag.	1	0
1	B000SATIZA	A23Q4B6O6E8GZ9	Davidson's Tea Bulk, Herb Pure Org Hibiscus	Now THIS is the product that is the PURE hibiscus and is the one I shall continue buying through Amazon.  For those who have high blood pressure issues, I totally recommend drinking hibiscus tea every day.  I drink it because I like it and because I DON'T want high blood pressure.	2	0
1	B001LGGH40	A17OYW896EY37V	Switch Kiwi Berry	I really enjoyed the Switch Kiwi Berry.  I was looking for an alternative to soda and this really filled that niche for me.  This flavor was very pleasant in my opinion, but that is a personal thing that everyone will have to decide on their own.  The Switch is 100% juice so you can feel good about giving it to your family and it is carbonated so the kids will think they are getting soda, a win win situation! Although it may be a little high in sugar, that is because it is fruit juice, not because it is loaded with corn syrup etc etc.<br />I would recommend this product and feel very comfortable giving it to my grandaughter.	0	0

-1	B0030VBRIU	A36OZXMZWPBZAG	Formula changed; mostly corn now; yuck	My son used to love the Chick Chick, Gobble Gobble, and Super Salmon. But they changed the recipe, and now it's more corn than anything else. Taste is bad too. Nutrition value is lower. He doesn't like it, and neither do I. I am totally pissed.	4	0
1	B001L1KH6Y	A3W23ZSGMZ8D7S	Price keeps going up	I love this coffee but I am not sure what has happened to the price lately I used to get this exact product on average for about 15 dollars and the price has skyrocketed to $40.  I am hesitant to buy this product again for this price	0	0

1	B001FA1JN6	A3K6I223PR0PMX	Better Tea	For the last year, our Tassimo machine has made only tea, as all the coffees are greatly lacking. Instead we buy imported German coffees which are the best in the world.<br /><br />We use 3 Teas: #1, the Best is Twinings Earl Grey<br />  #2, next best is Twinings Green Tea<br />  #3, next best is Tazmo Awake Black Tea.<br /><br />These teas are all great & if you can get some good natural North Dakota honey to put in them, you will like them even more.	1	1

1	B004391DK0	A2PJYTDF5FRMAK	AMAZING	So grateful for this!! What an amazing mix. It can be used to make some of the best gluten free products out there.

-1	B003EML8PM	A3M07VHNUZYW83	You have to be really desperate	After reading all the positive reviews, I was really looking forward to finally getting a very low carb (somewhat low calorie) snack that I can work into my low carb living.  I've had pork rinds from the stores and thought they were pretty good, so I expected this to be at or better than my local convenience store brand.  Wrong.  I was first disappointed with the texture.  After following the instructions to microwave from 1-2 minutes, some (about 1/4) were crispy, but the rest were almost like taffy and would stick to the teeth?  Perhaps I didn't cook long enough, so 2nd bag stayed in longer which made a few more crispy, but more burnt and chewy ones.  But texture is only 1/2 the problem, the biggest issue was that the product taste like the bag. The taste of the microwave bag seems to bake into the product giving them a paper bag taste.  Finally,those without the full paper bag taste didn't really have a lot of flavor.  They were salty (which is to be expected),but that's really all the flavor you get.  So if your desperate and too lazy to get out a store (or can't find any in a near by store), this may work for you.  It  works out to about $1.00 a bag, so I'm not totally disappointed as my dog loves them.  By the way, my dog gives them 5 stars.	1	2
1	B000I1RHMU	A1DBC47OWOILTQ	Yum!	This is one of my favourite teas.  My mom had picked up some a couple summers ago so that I'd have some tea to drink while visiting her.  I've had a horrible time finding it locally.  I've been drinking Stash's black chai spice instead, which also makes a nice cuppa, but the black and green blend has a nice, gentle flavour that is just marvelous.	9	0

1	B000G6RYNE	ARONI7W0W677H	Fresh, Lightly-Spiced, Crunchy Kettle Chips. Good Value, Good Product.	After buying bags one at a time (at a hefty markup) at nearby stores, I decided to try bulk ordering some snack foods on Amazon. I was very pleased with the price and the products.<br /><br />These jalapeno kettle chips are not overly spicy; they have a slow-building spice that starts very subtly a grows if you eat the whole bag, which I'm embarrassed to say I did quite a few times.<br /><br />The chips arrived well-packed and fresh. They had nearly a year of time before they expired, which is pretty impressive for chips.<br /><br />Most importantly, the price-per-bag was much, MUCH better than any local store could do, although I live near an expensive city, so that may play a role in the price difference.<br /><br />I wouldn't hesitate to order another box of these once I run out.	0	0
1	B001JK27ME	A2GDOLEDJVOWC1	Mild and Enjoyable	I have been trying different types of green tea to find one that is not too overpowering and where i can still reap the benefits of drinking green tea.  this one is it.  i put a packet of splenda in the equivalent of 2 1/2 cups of tea and even when i steep for up to 30 minutes (i get sidetracked when getting ready for work in the mornings) it is great, much more tolerable and less viscus than sencha.  i think i could even drink this one with no sweetener added.	1	0

-1	B006N3I84I	A37ERQQJ71PT9T	Defective seal	The coffee had a nice bold, flavor, but the foil on the cups were not properly sealed, and I mean all of the cups. Every brewing left grounds in the cup and sometimes made a complete mess because the water wasn't going through the brew tip.  The flavor of the coffee was not enough to warrant a better rating because we get this product for convenience and easy clean up, as much as for the flavor.	0	0
-1	B0040BESXK	A1R0U5L6R85K5M	Great food, but with the October 2012 price increase, not sure it's a good value.	UPDATED REVIEW (10/7/2012):  I am disappointed to see that Merrick increased the price of this food 50%!  The 8-pound bag used to be $8.69, but is now $16.00 and some change.  Whole Earth Farms is supposed to be an affordable way for responsible pet owners to feed their pets Merrick quality, but it seems Merrick has decided to up the ante based on this food's popularity.  I'm very disappointed by the decision and may have to switch back to my previous brand.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:  After deciding to switch from Nutro Max to Merrick Whole Earth Farms Adult Dry Dog Food, my dog literally does circles when it's time to eat.  The food is loaded with good stuff for my dog and it even smells better than our previous brand.  It obviously tastes better, too, because my dog just can't contain himself when it's time to eat.  His coat is shinier and seems really healthy, and on a semi-gross note, but important one, his stools have been much smaller; that tells me his body is absorbing more of the nutrition in this food than the last one.  I actually ended up reducing his food portion because he was gaining a little weight.  That's always a sign of a good dog food...the ability to feed less and the dog still receive great nutrition; that tells me there are much fewer fillers in this food than most.  I recommend you try it.	4	0
-1	B0030VBRIU	A2IRI9FQ3Y2THO	Smells and looks like cat food	"I purchased two boxes of this because previously I had purchased Happy Baby Chick Chick and my daughter loved it.  When I opened this pouch up I couldn't believe the smell and texture of the ""food"".  It smells just like cat food because it's fish.  And the texture is just like canned cat food.  I have two boxes of this that I can't use because my daughter gags as soon as I bring the spoon up to her mouth.  I don't blame her, I'm gagging as soon as I tear the package open.  The nutritional facts are outstanding but they need to make it taste and look better.  The Happy Baby Chick Chick is an actual hearty puree with pieces of chicken and pasta.  This is not even close."	1	2
1	B000G1X45G	A3HIBUY8VEUONW	Best Coffee in the U.S.	My husband and I recently moved here from Las Vegas to Steeler Nation. We have tried ever coffee on the shelves at all the supermarkets far and wide. We had been drinking Yuban for at least 10 years in Las Vegas. We called the District Manager for Kraft and found out that East Coast people don't like it or were not accustomed to it. West of the Mississippi is where you'll find it. So we had to order by the case load to satisfy our drinking pleasure. We got the best deal from<br />Amazon; and it arrived very quickly without paying anything extra in shipping fees.  Time to order it again!!	0	0
1	B000N62EKK	A38O3HBCYKNZ2N	BEST treats...	Best treats for anysize dog. No matter how large or small.  We give these to our local humane society as well.  They dont have the option of purchasing such hi quality treats.  our 45 pounder herding dog loves them.  and the small dogs think they are steaks... nearly jump 5ft for a piece.  dry and greasless and break easily.  can put directlly into pocket without concerns of residue transfer. my favorite and the dogs too.	1	0
1	B0029K5536	A3M5PXJAZEEPYY	Coffee review	I think Folgers is an excellent coffee choice. I have been drinking it ever since I have been drinking coffee, about 30 years. It is good at the beginning of the pot and just as good at the end of the pot.	0	0
-1	B000CONMBS	A2164D1E63LWBX	FDA Recalled this product after I received my order.	I hate returns.  FDA product recall come out after product was received.  In order to get a refund, product was to be shipped to Manufacture.  Someone at Amazon was able to refund the purchase without this hassle.  For that I'm greatful.  If I had to box, ship and now deal with a third party and the paperwork involved.  I would not have been a happy camper.  Customers should never have to go through a third party with recall issues.  I didn't, hope none of your other customers had to go through a maze to return product.<br /><br />Note:  Product tastes good.  At least when I have bought it at health food stores.  Didn't get to try my order from Amazon due to recall.	4	12
1	B0016FY6H6	A1R9YRTB6JQFWK	Great taste and convenient	This has a great rich taste. Remember this is ground whole leaf, so the tea is stronger than you may expect.  Not overly sweet and dissolves readily.  I use it during workouts mixed with ice water in a Polar bottle.	0	0
1	B000084ETV	A235XFQ4XRFBTW	Why mess with success?	My 20-month-old Toy Fox Terrier mix has been eating Canidae since I adopted her and changed her over from Science Diet, so I don't have an amazing transformation story.<br /><br />However,<br />1. She's only been sick twice to speak of. No unexpected need to go outside NOW or accidents in the house because of illness. What comes out of her is as predictable as the sunrise, albeit somewhat less pleasant overall.<br /><br />2. This 12-pound, high-energy dog eats just under 1 cup a day. A 40-pound bag lasts me about 6 MONTHS, which calculates as less than $7/month for food. Canidae may cost more than better-known brands, but it's a bargain for the improved nutrition and related benefits (see 1 and 3).<br /><br />3. It never occurred to me that it could be because of her food, but it's true she has basically no smell, as others have mentioned. She's in every way glossy, happy, clean, and puppy-like.	6	0
-1	B002YD0AFQ	A3430BFN4JVOSZ	Very Disappointed	"Claxton Dark Fruitcake has been a holiday tradition in our family since the mid 1950's. I ordered it directly from the company this year and when I served it at Thanksgiving, my guests and I thought I must have been fooled by a counterfeit website just claiming to sell Claxton fruitcakes.  It was at best 40% fruits and nuts and consisted of a gummy light colored ""cake"".  I emailed the company and expressed my disappointment.  After several emails back and forth and after today talking to one of the owners, they assured me that it was the original dark recipe.<br /><br />In reading the ingredients, I noticed that corn syrup, sugar and high fructose corn syrup were listed after flour which was the 4th ingredient.  At the very end were listed molasses, spices and 3 artificial food dyes.  High fructose corn syrup wasn't widely available until the mid 1970's to mid 1980's, so I'm not sure how it was one of the original ingredients.<br /><br />All of the people I talked to seemed to have the attitude that I was so stupid that I couldn't possibly be observing what I had correctly. Although they offered to send replacements if I returned it at my own expense, they told me that what I would receive would be identical to what I have.  One of the owners informed me that they had received zero complaints this year.<br /><br />I am grieving the loss of an almost 55 year tradition, but the other 4 cakes are now in the trash."	1	1
1	B0045Z6K50	AN979WZ568YNW	Really Good Coffee	I like strong coffee.  My husband doesn't.  I use this with 8 oz.  He uses it with 12oz.  We both like the taste.	0	0
1	B005C3IVN8	A3B6OOPXPAI4VZ	Buy It!	I buy it over and again and keep it on hand because I have never had any maple syrup that is any better for the price. And even spending a lot more money has never delivered me any better product.	0	0
-1	B0016PKA1C	A19OAB9Y3GT3SO	Save your money!	I rarely write reviews, but these pods are so awful, I was hoping to save even one person from wasting their money like I did.  The little green plug barely stays in -- even after twisting it -- so the water is always sloshing out.  And the clear plastic cover is absolutely the worst design.  It is nearly impossible to remove and actually snapped into shards when I tried to open one of the pods.  (And I can attest that those plastic shards are sharp!)  If you are able to actually open the pod, be prepared for the water to splash out from the bottom.  Even if the pods actually worked well and preserved the herbs (which they don't really do), they would not be worth the aggravation or cost.  Like another reviewer said, just put your herbs in a cup with a little water in the bottom and a plastic bag covering the top.  Works perfectly and costs nothing.  Please don't waste your money on this!	1	0
1	B00141UC9I	A1Q98GWIC8OQHZ	My dog is addicted!!!	My great dane has two torn acls and has arthritis in her hips... and she is ONLY three. Well we have done one surgery and will be doing the second next spring when she is healed. In the mean time I needed to find some DIFFERENT way to provide her with Glucosamine. Since she is so picky I needed something in a treat form. These are her FAVORITE thing to eat! I went to Petco and was going to buy ONE bag for $35 and realized this offer was for THREE bags at the same price. I could not be happier and neither can she. She has only been eating them for three weeks and is not even limping on her surgical knee (its been 8 weeks and it takes 12 weeks to fully heal). Even our vet is surprised she is doing this well and the only change was these treats! I recommend them to anyone who needs to help their pet enjoy their life to the fullest! BUY these! You wont regret it!!!!<br /><br />PS - I also bought the duck and she loves those too :)	1	1

1	B000I200NW	A1XZF9Y0O61CMH	I got the 2-lb Bellagio Chocolate Truffle!	Hey, every culture has their ideal preference in cocoa. Look at the humble Nestle Milo or even Ovaltine---every nation has variations. Made in Singapore or anywhere in Asia is sweeter than their Latino counterpart. Mexicans or Colombians like that strong cocoa taste.<br /><br />Ive also tried Neuhaus, Chirardelli and other store brands, but I prefer Bellagio because there's no need to mix in milk for that smooth Belgian taste.<br /><br />Belgium or European chocolates are different from America's Hersheys brand. Their chocolate mix is not overpowering.<br /><br />Bellagio Chocolate Truffle reminds me of Starbuck's Signature chocolate drink with less calories (thhe company phased out this brand because of high caloric content -- 700 calories for the venti)<br /><br />So if you're on the go or a busy mom like me, Bellagio choco is the best comfort drink this cold season.	1	0
1	B005RF029M	A2BSA73GSG0UFN	Pizza Napoletana Dough Flour ..... Mangia!!	So this stuff is a must have for making true pizza napoletana.  I'm really thrilled that it is so accessible here in the USA.  This flour makes the most silky smooth dough I've ever had the pleasure of getting sticky with, and it has a different (better for pizza) taste than the all-purpose store brand flour.  Sure It costs a little more, it's coming from Italy, but given that you can make about 6 pizzas per bag ... who's counting?  Get this stuff, some D.O.P. tomatoes, grow some basil, and make some Mozarella (okay, I admit, haven't done this one ... yet) but given the first couple items there and you're well on your way to the origins of pizza in Naples, Italy. Is it worth it??? I say Si!!! Mangia!!! (And Taylor's Market always comes through for my home shipments!... Cheers!)	1	0

1	B000CD87MI	A16X750Y5Z9O9B	Food of the Gods	Attiki honey has an excellent sweet natural flavor, is very thick, and quite possibly is the stickiest substance known to man. I would like to try some baklava made with this honey. After tasting this honey, I suspect some US honey suppliers are artificially sweetening their product. Attiki is sweet without being over-powering. Pricier than your standard supermarket honey, but well worth it. Recommended.	0	0

1	B002QWP89S	A3SHETU1D7IAXG	My Dog Likes Them!	Got the teenie greenies for my 16 1/2lb Shih Tzu- Lhasa Apso.  The package says that these are for dogs that range 5-15lbs, but I ordered them anyway (trying to save some money).  She loves them.  Gobbles them up straight away.<br /><br />Only advice-Stick to the poundage recommendation.  These treats are so small that I doubt my dog is getting the benefits of tartar control/removal.  On the bright side, she likes the taste, so they certainly work as regular daily treats.	0	0

1	B000VK6NDC	ACRL36N43HGB2	16 cats love it...	I have 16 cats ranging from 1 to 11 yrs old and every single one of them likes this.  I have tried Wellness, Holistic, Avoderm, Chicken Soup for the..., Merck Homestyle, BG (Before Grain), California Natural, and Evangers with mixed results.  This is the first canned food that all of them will not only eat but eat all of it.  I've fed them the Chicken and Liver flavor and the Seafood flavor so far and they seem to like both equally.  I find it a bit more expensive than I had hoped it would be, but then again there is no waste and I consider that in itself a savings alone.  I'm a firm believer in better ingredients and less fillers and allergens make for less poop, less litter use, fewer trips to the vet and an overall healthier cat.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I have tried all the flavors on my cats and the chicken and liver seems to be the one they like the most.  They have now officially rejected all the other flavors including the seafood flavor that they originally liked.  I also wanted to add that this is a very STRONG smelling brand of cat food, almost overpowering when I open the cans at feeding time.	3	0
1	B000F4H5FY	A2YB7DLC3FOR7W	Good Value on Great Tea Sampler	This variety pack of Twinings tea has four flavors.  The Lady Grey is my favorite, hands down. It makes delicious iced tea.  It has a crisp, clean taste.  The other three flavors are good also.<br /><br />I use only two bags to make a pitcher of iced tea and it's strong enough with just the two bags.  This tea can be found locally, but costs much more than the Amazon price.  This is my second purchase of this item.	0	0

-1	B000EF3E72	A260E9D6SE6GH8	"Overly ""fishy"" odor and taste"	I buy a lot of canned salmon, smoked and not. This time, I wanted a wild-caught version to avoid carcinogenic chemicals.  As soon as I opened the can, a powerful fishy smell took over the kitchen, more powerful than sardines.  The taste is overly fishy also.  Maybe it was a bad can.

1	B0016FY6H6	A2W7ZBU9A8HKR9	lightly sweetened green iced tea powder	i have never liked green tea but i knew it was good for me so i have been drinking it for a lot of yrs. i grew up living in the western usa and our neighbors were japanese. they were sweet and gave us tea from japan. my father enjoyed it every morning and added a tablespoon of honey and a little cream to it. he smoked all his life and died at 92. anyway, i found when at times i would quit drinking it i wouldn't feel as good as i did when drinking it. i got tired of boiling the water with the teabags and then getting everything in a container to put into the frig. i really drank a lot of it.  well, i stumbled onto a warehouse to pick up some things i had ordered and noticed this tea. i was immediately interested as you get to drink the whole tea leaf which gives you 10 times more antioxidants. wow, that was good for me so i got a couple cases and when i ran out searched the internet for stash brand. i really love it. i love that it is LIGHTLY SWEETENED, i love that i can just open a packet and throw it into my tumbler, add ice and water and be on my way. it's just right. but more then anything else i love the way it makes me feel. so much more energy and i truly believe it is helping my well being. no getting around about it i don't get sick often for sure. now i haven't tried the other brands and i feel i don't have to because i am so satisfied with this one. the price is also cheaper. i don't think you can go wrong with this choice.  perky	0	1

1	B000DZFMEQ	A1JSL6MV2XX0HW	best gf bread	This bread is super-easy to make in a bread machine, and it tastes great. The flour mix produces a flavorful bread which has a good texture. Far better than other bread mixes I've tried.	0	0
1	B0001W2W62	A1AJQUA9PEA90X	Favorite sprouting mix	We bought this mix a while ago from the Sprout House, along with four other mixes from a different vendor. Now that we're finally running out, it's time to write a review.  This mix is wonderful (and the only one of the five we'll be buying again).  It's delicious, it sprouts really well, and it holds up well afterward (we always have multiple batches of different mixes at the same time, and these sprouts can last the longest).  And I had no idea that radish sprouts taste just as good as radishes.  I look forward to trying other mixes from the Sprout House.	0	0
1	B002QWP89S	A32BYHWKU8GU7L	Very Effective	My veterinarian recommended these.  My dog is a German Shepherd, Pit Bull, Jack Russel mix.  His top part is huge but his legs- not so much.  Basically he needs his weight managed all the time because we don't want knee problems to develop.  At his last trip Dr. Kragness said he had a bit of a tartar problem (organic food related) and to try a greenie a day.  Well he's been chewing them for about 12 days and his teeth look great and as an added benefit his breath is clean, still hot but clean smelling.  In addition I've noticed that he doesn't have a lot of doggy gas like usual.  I thought the price was a bit steep but tried them on the word of the vet and for the obvious results we're getting I guess you get what you pay for here.	0	0

I can even blow bubbles with gum<br />while with Spry you can't.<br /><br />Hope this helps if you have to weigh the purchase between the two items.	4	0

1	B0032BXUJM	A3KKM0T1KY42HA	How Could You Be So Bold	"After FINALLY purchasing <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AQPMHA"">the best coffee maker</a> I've ever had in 40 years of drinking coffee, the hunt was on to find the best tasting coffee to go with it. When it comes to coffee, I suppose that it's really a ""to each his or her own"" thing. But I've tried 'em all, and out of all the various varieties that are offered here at Amazon, the K-cup that provides the most pleasurable mix of everything that I was looking for in a cup of coffee is undisputedly Emeril's Big Easy Bold.<br /><br />Nothing beats Emeril's Big Easy Bold. There are plenty of other brands trying to suggest that they're bold. I've tried the ""Midnight Magic"" brand; I've tried the ""Jet Fuel"" brand; I've tried the ""Donut Shop"" brand; I've tried all of the ""Extra Bolds""; but the K-cup that really tastes like the jet fuel packed cup of coffee that you get in the best donut shop is Emeril's Big Easy Bold.<br /><br />What's really cool is that whether you make a small cup or large cup of Emeril's Big Easy Bold, you won't lose the rich flavor. Most Keurig Coffee Makers have at least two buttons that let you choose to make a large or small cup. Some even have three buttons for a large, medium or small. I like a large cup. Some of the other brands noticeably lost some of their flavor as I went from a medium cup to a large...but not the Emeril's.<br /><br />There is no question here. If you like a darker roast that's full of flavor and packs a punch, you've found the right page here at Amazon. Wake up people, and add this to your cart. Bam!"	69	3

1	B002QWP89S	ASCE5545RQ01I	Greenies for a picky eater	"I had to pay a fortune to have our dog's teeth cleaned. Plus it was a difficult thing for her...she got very upset and was in pain for a few days. So I started using Greenies, and wow...they have her scheduled for a teeth cleaning that I will cancel, because it has kept her teeth so clean. Best of all, though, she is a very picky eater. Most things that are supposedly flavored to please dogs do not please her. She just won't eat them, but Greenies for teeth...she can't wait to have them. I just ask her if she wants to brush her teeth, and she is ready and waiting. The other night I got out her pills to give her for arthritis and made the mistake of getting out the greenie at the same time. She didn't want the pills although they were covered in peanut butter, which she usually loves. Once she finished the greenie, she wanted the ""peanut butter pills."""	0	0

1	B00213ERI0	A8ZY9LI1KBU2P	Cinnamon Thins = Yum!	Absolutely delicious cookies - crisp & crunchy, but not hard; sweet, but not too much so. Since a lot of the gluten-free foods I've tried have left (IMHO) something to be desired, these were a very pleasant surprise. The grandkids love them too - a true test of cookie goodness.<br /><br />I can buy these locally for about $3 per 5.5 ounce box. I offer this info so that buyers can decide if Amazon's current price, whatever it may be, is a bargain.<br /><br />Highly recommended.	0	1
1	B003LTPY08	A1AULJ471YG7X3	Great Variety	The assortment was great. I received 5 to 6 of each flavor. I was a little leary of the blueberry but it is delicious. I will definatly order again!	0	0
1	B001BDDTB2	A250AXLRBVYKB4	Very healthy cat food. Much better than almost any other	This is some of the healthiest cat food on the market. It is all natural and doesn't contain food byproducts. What comes out of the can looks like real food (just below human quality) not a mash-up of mysterious goop. The fish in these cans has texture, and smells better than other cat food.<br /><br />My two cats absolutely love it.<br /><br />If you want a healthy cat food that is natural and not made in China, give these a try. I can't guarantee your cat(s) will love it as much as mine, but if they don't like it, they need to grow taste buds!	0	0
1	B002BCD2GO	A3P1T03UHU5QZB	Heavenly	After reading how good Agave Nectar is for you and a number of excellent reviews, I decided to take the plunge and order Madhava's Agave Nectar Light in the 46 oz. bottles, pack of two.  Not having a clue as to how good or bad this product was going to taste, I was very nervous and wondered if I had made a wise decision or big mistake.  I couldn't wait to try it and was delightfully surprised.  In tea, it tastes sweeter than sugar.  In smoothies, it's sensational.  Even a spoonful is wonderful.  My husband loves it in his oatmeal and I like to mix it with dehydrated coconut and raw cacao nibs for a real treat.  I could not be more pleased with my discovery!	44	1
1	B005LURBGA	A1BS1FBE3TUECE	Great Stuff !	This product is exceptional.  When poured into the bottle of water, it starts dissolving, not sitting in pile at the tope of the bottle neck, spilling over the side like another brand.  Great flavor, refreshing and satisfying.	1	0

1	B002BRC562	A3T70VLIE84FLM	Energy +	I start popping a package when I can feel that wall coming on.  These are easy to open while cycling and give a decent boost within a relatively short period of time.  As always, organic is a definite positive.

In fact, I can use about 1/2 of this and get the same ""oomph"" as the other teas.  It REALLY swells up when the water is added.  DELICIOUS. It seems it's less stemmy and more leafy.  Yum.  I'm a green tea lover, and I understand that the Japanese green teas provide more polyphenols than most of the Chinese green teas, and Sencha is one of the best for polyphenols.  Highly recommended!"	15	0
1	B007TJGZ54	A17WKG1SW7IRI0	Great mild breakfast coffee!	My wife has drunk this coffee for several years.  She tried many different brands before settling on this k-cup.

1	B0030VBRIU	ACU1MBQ7T5YL0	Yummy protein	I usually buy Sprout and thought I'd try this food since it got other great reviews.<br /><br />I am pleased with this meal.  It's a little less chunky than Sprout's stage 3 meals...so I worried a bit less about my baby gagging on it as he's learning to chew more.<br /><br />Also, the chicken, sweet potato is a big hit with my baby.  He ate it all up!<br /><br />These organic meals are a very nice alternative to making my own food for him.	3	0
1	B001E5E20O	A73DFWJE0CGY6	A little sip of heaven on a miserable day	I received this tea today, a wet, chilly, dreary day with no promise but rain and sniffles; I immediately came home and opened it and got the hot pot going. The aroma that escaped upwards from the can was heavenly; delicate, alluring, definitely Earl Grey but with whispers of bergamot, a lemony, citrusy warmth that made me feel good immediately. I put aside all other endeavours for a time and gave myself up to a retreat with this wonderful light tea. Don't brew it more than 4 minutes; let the essence of the bergamot exude from the tea. Both your sense of taste and your sense of smell will be the better for having indulged in this tea. A lovely cap on a grey, ugly day.<br /><br />Rishi Earl Grey Tea is 100% Organic Fair Trade tea, grown by and harvested by the ethnic peoples of the Yunnan Province of China from tea trees planted in 696 A.D. By buying Fair Trade teas, the minority peoples who grow the tea benefit, through community developments and direct trade. The benefit to the purchaser is in knowing that they are doing a good thing for the earth and for the small farmer. I've just started seeing Fair Trade items coming onto the market, and I try to patronize the small farmer. You won't be cutting any corners by drinking this tea; it's truly a great beverage. It also says on the can that one serving can be used multiple times, so don't cavalierly throw it out after the first cup. Very recommended.	0	0

-1	B002QWP89S	A27O8U73ZPLSCE	Greenies are not digestible -your puppy will vomit and have diarrhea and will get very sick	"I made the mistake to give a Greeny to my puppy without reading reviews about this product. It was a bad idea. The poor puppy got very sick after eating a Greenie. He vomited and had diarrhea.<br /><br />I took him to urgent care and the Vet's verdict(informed on the X-ray)was: ""a Greenie got stocked in his intestine"".<br /><br />I was very lucky to get the puppy recovered with medicine. But surgery was being considered by the Vet (mind about $7,000). On the worst case scenario, my puppy could have died because his intestinal system was obstructed for 3-4 days.<br /><br />After this unfortunate incident, I looked-up for reviews about this unsafe product -and not to be surprised- I found several concerning stories like mine. I also learned that few dog owners have sued Greenies because they believe it was the reason that provoked an obstruction to their pets digestive system, sadly resulting on death. ""Roughly 315 million Greenies were sold last year, but the breath-freshening treats have been blamed for at least 13 pet deaths and more than two dozen complaints have been filed with the Feds"". Dogster-com<br /><br />Note that as the product label says: Greenies are not 100% digestible, and if you read with more attention, the label has a Warning saying that: dogs may get sick or even chock when ingesting a Greenie!<br /><br />At the end of the day, it's hard to believe that there are companies like Grennies that don't address these issues, and just care about marketing and profiting -not so much about producing a healthy, safe treat for our best buddies.<br /><br />In any case, I'd recommend to ask your Vet or read more dog owners reviews before giving Greenies to your dog."	9	10

1	B0032RPLSY	AVEG0BR0T7USH	Tastes amazing, but a bit expensive	"I tried both this brand and the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0046IIPMW"">Purity Farm Organic Ghee, Clarified Butter, 13-Ounce</a> brand of ghee because as far as I can tell these are the two brands that are from completely grass fed cows, which I was elated to see because of the health and flavor benefits.<br /><br />I'll say that this one takes the slight edge in the taste and aroma department. It has a rich buttery smell, and it seems like they clarify it a little less because it's slightly grainy when you taste it at room temperature.<br /><br />That said, I find myself buying the Purity Farm ghee because this brand is almost twice as expensive and while it has the edge in taste, it is very very slight and not worth the big premium to me. It might be worth it if I was primarily using this at room temperature like on bread, but I usually use regular butter for that, and for cooking you really cannot tell any difference in flavor. There is also a chance I am getting ghee from different times of the year for each brand which does affect the flavor.<br /><br />So in short, amazing high quality ghee, but a bit overshadowed by the much cheaper and also amazing high quality <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0046IIPMW"">Purity Farm Organic Ghee, Clarified Butter, 13-Ounce</a> brand ghee."	14	1

1	B000084ETV	A3LY5F58098WPR	Excellent. Product HAS NOT changed.	I have been a Canidae (PAWS) customer since Feb 07 (7 lg dogs). I previously fed them Purina One, switched to Blue Buffalo in Dec 06, then Canidae in Feb 07 (food scare for Blue Buffalo). I am very particular about what I give my dogs: dog of 10yrs died/cancer and had 2 knee replacements due to arthritis/joint issues. My Dogs are doing great on Canidae. I just spoke w/ Canidae less than 2 mins ago and they HAVE NOT changed their product at all. I read the review from the person that once gave this product a great review and now thinks the product has changed due to her dogs' digestive issues (or something like that).  I left a msg for Canidae about 20 mins ago, and they already called me back at work to answer my questions (unlike Blue during the food scare).  If you have seen a blog concerning something about Acetaminophen being in Canidae, that is false. Some lady said she had Canidae and some other foods tested by putting them in a baggie together...blah blah, any way it was a false allegation but the internet spreads rumors like wildfire. I drive 2 hrs to re-stock on Canidae. Highly recommend.	7	1
-1	B001EO60EQ	A16Y3NZR5FP7JQ	Horrible	I purchased the 6-pack of these lemon tea cookies and waited with great anticipation for the melt-in-your-mouth, powdered sugar-covered shortbread lemon tea cookies I was expecting; what I received was 6 boxes of cookies that tasted like chemicals. I don't know if they were old and had gone off or had been stored in some plastic container that had leached the plastic into the cookies or if the makers just used some sort of artificial lemon flavoring rather than actual lemon but any lemon flavor they might've had was nearly undetectable, overpowered by a medicinal chemical flavor. They kind of tasted like Bactine smells. Needless to say I would not recommend these cookies to anyone but if you really want to try them let me know, I still have 5 unopened boxes... (To be fair, I can't say for sure ALL the boxes tasted like this, just the one I happened to open. I will not, however, be trying any of the other boxes I still have.)	1	0
-1	B00390T5JA	A3E3EQ39FZTZEK	Short-cupping due to faulty design-	"These machines are prone to not pumping water and ""short-cupping"" (delivering too little water into the cup. Keurig likes to tell people they need to descale because that means its a user problem and not a design problem. But using distilled water won't prevent the problem. If it did, a lot of us would be happier--not thrilled but happier. You need to read thru all the comments to understand the prob. Keurig has changed the pumps in their design at last 3 times in the last two years but the problem isn't the pumps; it's the valves.<br /><br />The most reliable way to unstick the valves is to remove the water tank, unplug the device, hold it upside down over the sink and give it a goo whack on the bottom. Really this works. If you think that's an ok way to operate a device that costs this much, then this machine is for.<br /><br />More recently we've heard that Keurig support is telling folks that they cannot get a refund or replacement under warranty anymore because too many machines have been returned. Not honoring warranty? I don't see how that's legal. I can believe they are overwhelmed with returns, but that's the cost of business when you sell a bad design, keep selling it, keep insisting it's just scale build-up, keep refusing to continue selling the product. They should have had full recall or refund for its customers."	2	1

I turned out to really like that flavor, but others may not.	1	0

-1	B001CGTN1I	A21INUA35HX4XQ	HOLY BLOATING! Dont use too much in one meal!	I love the Nativa brand, however, they always seem to leave out very important details on their packaging.<br /><br />I heard so many praises about how much better the Chia seeds are than Flax seeds.<br /><br />Upon arrival I opted to use these in my salad as opposed to the flax seeds I've been using.<br /><br />The Chia seeds caused the most horrible and painful bloating I ever experienced. Granted, I did use the full serving size, but since then I lowered the amount and STILL with even just a quarter of a teaspoon or less I get the bloating.<br /><br />I have since switched back to the Flax seeds which didn't wreak havoc on my intestinal tract.<br /><br />I am hoping I can find some way to use these seeds in the future because I hate seeing anything go to waste.<br /><br />My advice if you are set on trying the Chia seeds is to start out with a very low amount!!! And stick with that low amount until your stomach builds up a tolerance for these seeds.	8	5

-1	B001LG945O	A2SH6A32BE6NEV	Decent tasting, but too small and overpriced	I drank a single can of the Switch Orange Tangerine flavor today.  Upon first impression, the physical size of the can is a tiny -- 8oz or 250ml.  This in contrast to a regular can of soda size which is 12 ounces or 355 ml.  Therefore, only about 2/3 the content of a normal can of soda.  To say the least, this isn't enough liquid for me in one sitting.  I need more to drink than that to quench a tiny bit of thirst so I was quite disappointed without even opening the thing up.<br /><br />The taste of the drink itself was satisfying.  Since there is no added sugar (which is usually corn syrup in the US) the flavor was not too sweet nor was it too bland.  However, it wasn't anything like drinking a fresh bottle of 100% natural juice.  More on the side of mixed syrup with water.<br /><br />What kills this product is the high price.  Product right now comes out to about a buck a can.  I would be angry paying that out of a vending machine for its small size but for purchasing in bulk, it is an insult to say the least.  Not worth the money.	0	0

1	B001LXYA5Q	A1KVVR8NF2T28U	Amazing.	I just bought the mberry with slight concerns that it will not work. All those concerns went away when I tried it. It was a tingly feeling at first where ever it was on the tongue. I didn't notice anything. First thing i tried was a grape. I mean this was the most delicious grape I had ever tasted. I started try all the fruits and sodas i could. Amazing. People don't realize that you should use it on fruits and things with acidity. It is supposed to make them sweeter. Although it did make one of my cookies sweeter it wasn't nearly as dramatic as when I ate a lime. It tasted like lime-ade. I wouldn't suggest eating a bunch of lemons because this only affects your tongue. Not your stomach. When you buy these you run the risk that it won't work, but it probably will. Very pleased.	1	0

1	B000G17Y9I	A1GQAKL9CGQLP1	Great Shape for Dipping!	If you're looking for a healthy, natural tortilla chip for dipping, you should try these.  I bought these for the holidays and we enjoyed dipping them in a corn, black bean and red pepper salsa.  The shape is perfect for dipping.<br />They're all natural, low-calorie chips that taste great.  You can eat 12 chips for 130 calories--the chips are big and can be broken in half for more dipping.  One serving of 12 chips is only 10% of your allowed fat and there's no trans-fat and little saturated fat.  Can't wait to try them with guacamole--great treat for parties.	0	0

Looks I've learned that grocery shopping on Amazon is not a particularly good idea.  Since I bought three different 1lb bags of this stuff in different flavors I'm out some cash.  Granted this one was the only one with mold, but the other two were complete inedible as they were made from cartilage scrap cuts - the stuff that either gets thrown away or fed to the pigs.

This is made with artificial flavor, mono and di-glycerides, and egg albumin - it's soft and tastes fake.

1	B002BRC562	A13XR3IVWHR9Z4	Great for Marathon Training	I'm training for my first marathon in November 2011 and these chews have kept me going during my long 18 to 20 mile training runs.  I dissolve them in water rather than carry them as chews and sip steadily after mile 8.  They taste like concentrated hawaiian punch and do not upset my stomach whatsoever.  I also eat them prior to a workout if I am feeling low energy and will even snack on them in lieu of candy.  Seriously, they are that good.  I have tried GU as well as Powerbar gels and both do the trick but are nowhere near as tasty.  The consistency of the chews are slightly softer than DOTs candy.	0	0

1	B000KV61FC	A1WSNXYC7HF73D	Took a while to figure out, but great toy!	I got the medium/large size about 2 weeks ago for my 2 year old, 40lb dog. He is a generally smart dog so I was a little disappointed when for the first several days all he would do was lick where the rope went into the toy in hopes of getting the food out. Now, a week or so later he is knocking it all around and seems to have really gotten a hang of it. All of his food fits into the toy, (about a cup) and I am sure more would fit for a larger dog. I think now that he has figured it out I may start putting his meals into it so he doesn't eat too much.<br /><br />This is one of the original reasons why I bought this toy, because he bolts down his food and bloat was a concern. Plus it will give him something to do when I am away at work. On the quality of the material, I would say the plastic bottle is very  hard and seems tough enough to handle being  whacked around against the floor and walls. I cannot give an accurate account, however, because my dog has not shown any interest in chewing this toy. The ball at the end of the neck is a softer plastic, and I think that if he wanted to he could chew it up, but again he is mainly focused on the food aspect, not necessarily chewing up the toy itself.<br /><br /> I would say give your dog some time to figure out the toy and don't be surprised if it takes a week or so to figure out, because now that he has he is always pushing it around the floor.	1	0

At first it was peach, then banana.  Juicy pear came along and that was my favorite for about ten years.  I thought nothing would top it, ever.  Then I tried red apple.

1	B006N3I84I	A2T3P2JUC23ISH	Italian roast - just how i like it	"After years of drink the same old Folgers drip coffee a group of us decided to purchase a Keurig unit for our office.  When any one of us purchase a pack of K-Cups we often share with other so that we can find our favorite, and not spend on those that just are not up to par.  I enjoyed the flavor of the Italian roast, and the people that I shared it with said they did too.  So far, out of the ten or so K-Cup ""flavors"" that I have tried this is my favorite.  Being that it is a ""bold"" coffee - I can change the cup volume setting of my Keurig unit to alter the boldness...a larger setting yields a slightly less bold cup, and the smaller cup setting will increase the boldness of the taste.  Of course you can do this with any coffee, this coffee seems to fit the boldness range that i desire."	0	1

We always buy the large size and cut off a little to give to our other dog as a treat at the same time so the dog getting the pill is none the wiser. I can't imagine needing to shove a pill down our dog's throat again.	0	0

-1	B0017T1LI8	AAJZFZNWSDXDH	Just a word of warning for those that love this tea	Look at the ingredients...it is made with Black Tea...Google Black tea and Fluoride and you will see that black tea is LOADED with fluoride because it is made with the oldest part of the tea plant it contains the highest level of fluoride of any tea. Fluoride is not healthy for anyone. If you want a healthy natural tea, get one that is made with white tea leaves. White tea leaves still have all the beneficial antioxidant properties but much, much , much less fluoride than either black or green teas.	0	5
1	B0028VAQSU	A1P8JY7IH255G4	Better than Gluten!!!	This is our second time purchasing the 25lb bag of Pamela's pancake and baking mix.  Last time it came with a label with baking instructions, but this time it didn't.  Good thing I had cut off my label and put it in the bucket with the pancake mix.  But other than that, this mix couldn't be more perfect.<br />Since being diagnosed celiac and trying to balance gluten free/gluten eating in the same kitchen with 7 people, we opted to move everyone gluten free at home.  This mix is a godsend and seriously, it tastes remarkable!!  It is a real time saver and what we do instead of drive thru windows, these days.  I make a bunch and keep them in the freezer so they can be pulled out, toasted and made into a quick PB&J for the kids.  I am so grateful to be able to purchase this is bulk as it makes GF eating much easier for our above average family size and keeps my kitchen GF!!	0	0
-1	B0051TPWUI	A2ILSYQM0CO9SC	Too Much Sugar!	"This is basically candy masquerading as a ""healthy"" snack. They taste good - because they have three different kinds of sugar in them! Blue Diamond  wants you to think that eating sugar is a healthy snack - c'mon!<br /><br />I purchased these thinking they were sweetened with stevia. Yeah, there's a miniscule amount of stevia (very last ingredient) - but sugars are the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th ingredient listed. These have corn maltodextrin - the worst thing there is on the glycemic index (can you say fat formation?). Now I'm stuck with 3 containers of this sugar snack."	0	0
1	B001CGTN1S	A1ZWM7T7R6MO02	#1 superfood	"Nutritional benefits of Chia seeds are amazing. Here are a few to start:<br /><br />*According to studies, Chia possesses the highest percentage of the polyunsaturated fatty acids(linolenic and linoleic) of all crops. Chia seeds contain 60% omega 3 fatty acids.<br /><br />*The protein content of Chia is higher that other nutritional grains. Unlike other grains, it is a complete protein, meaning that it has the appropriate balance of all essential amino acids. About 19 to 23% of chia seeds weight is protein.<br /><br />*Chia seeds are high in fiber, a 15 gm serving of chia seeds will provide 4 to 5 gm of fiber. Our body requires at least 35 gm of fiber a day to stay healthy.<br /><br />*Chia seeds contain boron which is essential for bone health.<br /><br />*Chia seeds are rich in calcium, about 2 oz of chia seeds contains 600 mg of Calcium, as compared to 120 mg for a cup of milk.<br /><br />*Chia seeds have 2 times more potassium than banana.<br /><br />*Chia seeds have 3 times more antioxidants than blueberries<br /><br />Regardless of the astonishing nutritional values of Chia, it also tastes very good. My girlfriend and I make a big pot of ""steel cut"" oatmeal at night (the quick way is throw a cup of oats in 4 cups of boiling water and just let it sit overnight), put in a good helping of chia powder, and the next morning you have a wonderful breakfast that could last all week depending on how many people are eating it. Feel free to add a little cinnamon, peanut butter, fruit, or your own oatmeal favorite additions.<br /><br />There are many other recipes for eating Chia, but oatmeal is my personal favorite.  I started eating Chia last year after reading the NY Times Bestseller 'Born to Run' about how a tribe of Mexicans that eat Chia will drink beer, smoke tobacco, and then run up to 500 miles in a footrace the following days.  One of the primary contributors to the tribal Mexicans' seemingly supernatural physical ability is that their diet is full of the nutrient-rich Chia seeds. I haven't put in 500 miles.  But after previously failing to finish a 26-mile marathon without chia in my diet, I added chia to my diet and my knees allowed me to finish my first 26-mile marathon!  Could the Chia have helped?  I think so.  I certainly had more energy and my joints felt better my second attempt at a marathon when ""on"" the Chia.<br /><br />I started out paying an arm-and-a-leg at Whole Foods for Chia powder, but have since started buying them on Amazon for a fraction of the price. My suggestion is to get some Chia and make a delicious bowl of oatmeal for one of the healthiest breakfasts possible."	12	1

The cans were obviously not bent or damaged in shipping.  The cans were crated, wrapped in bubble wrap, and packed in an undamaged Amazon shipping box.  It was as if someone picked through the cans and packed dented and bent cans.  I considered returning the order but needed it right away.  I use the pumpkin to moisten dry food for my dog which eats special food for severe allergies.  The pumpkin was fine but the impression created by the vendor with the condition of the cans was not acceptable.  I do not intend to order from this vendor again.	0	0

This small 8 oz. packet does clump together a lot more than other sweeteners so there is less of an advantage over using honey in a jar and spooning out the crystallized honey.<br /><br />For the price I consider it a poor value.

-1	B0030VBRIU	AMVZ2L5AOV098	dried texture and crappy blend for baby food	I have tried many different flavors from many different brands and by far, this particular flavor from Happy Baby is the worst texture and taste that I ever bought for my baby.  My baby just doesn't like it.  I let her try it three times and she just hates the texture and the taste.  I don't why they made the food so dry to begin with.  Turkey itself gives a little dried texture compared to chicken and they should have taken that into consideration.  And the food is so lumpy and it's not even in good chunky blend either.  In the end it was a total waste of money to buy this product.	0	0

None of the cans in my shipment had any dents at all, so maybe he just got a bad batch.  Anyway, it's 12 cans of pasta, almost a pound each, for 12 bucks and change.  It's relatively low in fat (even if you eat the whole can which is supposed to be two servings), low in cholesterol, and a can is 18 grams of protein with 10 grams of fiber.  Only the sodium is high, though lower than most canned soups.  It's hearty and satisfying, and the filling is spicier than most canned pastas.<br /><br />Folks, you can't beat an entree like that at a buck a can.  Order two cases and it's eligible for free shipping.  They have many other varieties too.  I'd buy it again in a heartbeat.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003XUJ564"">Chef Boyardee Big Overstuffed Italian Sausage Ravioli, 15-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>"	9	0

My dogs do not chew the rope (or I would remove this toy and replace with something more appropriate). They seem to recognize that the rope is helpful in removing kibble from the jug.

From doing some research I found that the reson they can't ship to an APO address is the vender uses either FedEx or UPS and they can't ship to an APO address.  It doesn't bother me that the vender can't ship, or for that mater won't take the initiative to sell to US Service People overseas, it is they Lied about it."	3	2

After tasting it, I had to agree with him.  Maybe he does not like green peppers either.  If I recall correctly, the ingredients do not have yellow or red peppers as shown on the picture, but rather there are green peppers.  I was very disappointed as it looked good in the picture, it sounded nice & healthy, and my baby loves all their other products.

It tastes like sour orange juice with some carbonation in it.  It doesn't taste anything like orange soda, and the taste it does have isn't very pleasant.  Also leaves a very nasty aftertaste, and like many sodas, this will leave you more thirsty than when you started drinking.  All in all, I cannot recommend this.  Stay away.	0	0

He is also allergic to dairy. So, I searched and tried many kinds of wheat free bread mix/recipes and he might eat 2 bites and then stopped with sad face or he would cry. He said ""it's yucky, grainy, tasted bad..."". I often hid my tears, 'cause I knew I needed to be strong for him. Once I even ordered a bread from a bakery chef, $6.50/loaf, and my son took one bite and that's it!<br /><br />Then in June I checked out Amazon, and found this product. The review said it's moist and not grainy, and I was so desperate, so I ordered a box of 6! That ended my search!!<br /><br />When I put the 1st loaf on the dining table, my son could not stop eating it (and of course, I cried secretly in the kitchen!). I also ordered the cake mix, and chocolate chip cookies mix. I can't express how thankful I am to see my son's bright eyes as he enjoys his bread. By the way, I like it too.

-1	B001P3NU30	A120V2QHKYBJBQ	Something's not right	I'm not sure who's supplying these or where they're coming from. We've bought them several times on Amazon because it's convenient and cheaper than getting them at the vet. Our dog loves them. But I opened the lkast bag I got, and the dog would chew them but not with the same enthusiasm. Almost like someone getting a glass of milk that was going sour. I'd find half of one lying uneaten/unchewed. Then she chewed of the corner of one, left the rest, and seemed lethargic. Later that day she vomitted. All that came out was yellow bile and a piece of the chew. We, of course, haven't given her any more. My wife called the company to report what happened, and when she told them where we bought them, they said we couldn't have bough them through Amazon because they're only sold through veterinarians. We're not buying any more of them on line.	9	2

1	B003H26J5I	A25JTWKEV42YLS	So much better than the Non Tofu Shirataki!	I have tried both the Tofu Shirataki and the Non Tofu Shirataki. The non-tofu variety is very gel/gummy (literally like little strands of flavorless gummy worms). I ate the non-tofu noodles, because, hey they are sooo low calorie/carb. But now that I've tried the tofu shirataki which contains only 20 calories per serving, I am sold on the tofu shirataki. Tofu noodles were more like ramen noodle consistency. Perhaps not the exact same texture as a real flour based noodle, but for the calories and carb content these are excellent!<br /><br />As with any shirataki noodle, you do have to make sure you wash, wash and wash them some more. If there is any scent at all, you have not washed them enough. About 2 or 3 minutes seems to do the trick for me. I made a low carb peach kugel (dessert) with the fettuccine and a stir fry with the angel hair. I just could not believe how much better they were than the non tofu variety.<br /><br />I was also very impressed with the seller (Low Carb You Foods). These arrived within 2 days on regular shipping, shipping all the way across the country. And, I bought 2 different varieties with no additional charge on the shipping! I will certainly be back again.	0	0
1	B000DZFMEQ	A25B8KJR805N9	Best GF bread!	This is the best all-around GF bread I've found. The taste and texture are good. It stays moist and soft even after refrigeration or sitting in a lunch box for a few hours. To save money I bake mostly from scratch, but I can't find a bread recipe that matches the all the wonderful qualities of this bread. No microwaving necessary with this bread. The only dowside I've found, is that its a little dense.	0	0

1	B002BUEN2S	A21C1M8B8DG17S	There is good and then there is wonderful	"Cobblestone Kitchen's Irish Creme Hot Cocoa mix has got to be the most luxurious tasting cocoa on the market.  We originally bought this cocoa to use as a base for Frappuccinnos but quickly decided it was way to good to waste in a mix.  The flavor is rich and smooth.  We have made it a part of our winding down for bed time procedure - a couple of cups together and just relax.<br /><br />Cobblestone Kitchen refers to the cocoas as ""Delicious and Decadent""  and they are being extremely modest."	0	0

I bought a bottle of Blackberry Balsamic Vinegar last fall at a county fair, and since it is now running low, I attempted to find the brand that I had purchased at the fair, but to no avail.  When I found the Blackberry Ginger Balsamic Vinegar at Amazon, I decided to give it a try.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that it is as good as, if not better than, the old stuff.  I will definitely reorder!	1	0
1	B001EQ4G54	ATPJXNNT5HXYP	best home taco mix	By far the best home taco kit you can get. I  tried all the other ones you can find in local stores and not only is this one better I don't like the other ones.  It is a combination of the mix & shells having a strange taste to them.  Most local grocery stores don't seem to be carrying this anymore so I have them delivered every 3-6 months automatically depending on how often we go through them.  Taco night is one of my 3 year old son's favorite nights as he gets to make his own taco!	1	0

1	B000CMF1A0	A1OMOAUSDQUAM7	Love this tea!	I love drinking this tea, I am able to go through all 6 packs myself over a couple semesters at school. I drink it at least once per day. Tastes absolutely amazing with KAL Stevia, highly recommended to try pairing the two! I love the licorice taste mixed with the peppermint. Perfect before bed.<br /><br />PROS<br />+Value (Amazon offers a consistent solid value on Yogi teas).<br />-Tastes amazing with Stevia.<br />+Great post-dinner treat.<br /><br />CONS<br />+Herbal tea versus green tea, some may argue the benefits are greater from green tea, but I love the taste of this tea, so I tent to drink it more making it more beneficial in my eyes.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE<br />If your thinking about ordering this tea, grab some Stevia to go with it (I would recommend KAL brand, known to have less aftertaste) and you like peppermint and licorice, order this tea! Brew yourself a cup of tea, and add one to three servings of Stevia depending on the size, and enjoy!	0	0

I suffer from chronic sinus infections and since I've started drinking this I've noticed that the number and severity have decreased. It definitely helps with immune system support. The taste is pleasant, but if I want something sweet (or to coat my throat when it's sore) I add a little eucalyptus honey and it's divine. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS!	0	0

Also, the flavor is very, very overpowering and kind of tastes like bananas.<br /><br />It is a pretty good mid-afternoon or evening desert coffee, but other than that it is kinda gross.	2	2
1	B000NU8H0C	AY12DBB0U420B	Real Fruit Juices With Added Carbonation, But No Added Sugar	Our nearby Fresh and Easy grocery store has a small section of premium soft drinks and some of them are really good. Just recently I purchased a 4-pack of Izze Sparkling Blackberry. It's an assortment of concentrated fruit juices dominated by blackberry with added carbonated water. The label says 70% fruit juices. This is not your average fruit-flavored soda pop, folks. This is real fruit juice and with no added  sugar. The taste is delicious and the blackberry stands out real nicely. The drink has a lot of natural sugars, but you don't get that sickening sweet taste I associate with so many of the  cheaper soft drinks. In fact, the drink has a slight sour bite to it and it's very pleasant. This stuff is more expensive, but maybe it's worth it. Personally, I'm looking forward to trying some of the other varieties.<br /><br />Gary Peterson	0	0

1	B003NCEDYG	A15FZPPJW17W1L	best of the Wabash I tried	Went to the store in downtown Lake Placid. Bought a large bag of the extra-large caramel style, the red, and the purple. My wife and I agree the purple is the best. It is more dense and not chewy at all. It has a richer flavor. The red was second place, great but just not quite as good with poor popping. The extra-large was third. The extra-large was large and popped great, but it lacked the flavor and was slightly chewy. You could see that it would be great for caramel popcorn, but not for simple butter and sea-salt popcorn like we prefer. Still, they were all good.<br /><br />The correct way to pop: High heat on canola oil in a pot. Add 3 kernels. When they pop, add rest. Cover with spatter shield, this will keep the kernels in but let the steam out.<br />Enjoy!	4	0

I absolutely love them.  They are very tasty and have a not-too sweet nutty flavor.  Yes, there are some color variations in the bag, but it doesn't change the texture or flavor.  I eat them in salads, smoothies, with oatmeal, made chocolate candy with them, and eat them straight out of the bag!  I have not found a negative thing about them.  You should try them, you might like them as much as I do!  And, they are organic which is important to me.	2	0

1	B002JWZVWO	AORGKBNQZ83O8	"""...with a 'SPLASH' of Pink Guava"""	I'm somewhat perplexed as to why reviewers slammed this for not having enough flavor because the name says it all. This is supposed be a light, subtly flavored beverage. I think it's delicious.<br />I'm also left scratching my head as to assertions that this product contains sugar; it contains CANE JUICE which is not only far more dilute than sugar but is enjoyed on its own as a delicious, healthful beverage and is well worth sampling if you can find it (it's fairly easy to find fresh in NYC's Chinatown). For the record, it's not sickeningly sweet and is claimed to have anti-cariogenic properties (I love the stuff). Don't downgrade a product because you don't know how to interpret what's printed on a label (let the negs begin).<br />O.N.E. Coconut Water with a Splash of Pink Guava is very refreshing when you're in need of an electrolyte boost and I agree with other reviewers that 8.5 ounces is insufficient for a fierce thirst; I hope O.N.E. has this flavor slated for 1-liter packaging. The flavor is exquisite, as is the color. This also makes a great base for a pink guava smoothie--blend with a frozen banana, coconut milk (canned is fine), frozen pink guava pulp, and a sweetener of your choice (coconut sugar would be great). Delicious AND pretty! You could also, if you prefer a different liquid (such as yogurt or fruit juice), freeze it in an ice cube tray and add to the other ingredients to thicken and chill your smoothie--it's the kind of product you can get creative with if you're into playing in the kitchen.<br />To sum it up, O.N.E. Coconut Water with a Splash of Pink Guava does NOT contain added sugar, doesn't claim to be a juice, and is well worth trying, especially if you can find it on sale. In addition, although I'm a Vine Voice, this product wasn't offered to me for review; I'm of my own initiative evaluating my own purchase. Enjoy!	8	0

-1	B001COFVQG	A1A3CW47079WGB	bad experience buying mixed nuts online for the first time	"The Pack of 3 arrived but by the look of them they don't seem to be worth the price. A bit pricey, and may as well get mixed nuts from local grocery supermarkets, I thought. Not happy.<br /><br />One of the three packs came half-filled, making it a pouch with less than 5 Ounce of mixed nuts, although the pouch is intact so I guess that was a faulty product. Not happy times 2.<br /><br />One of the two seemingly 10 Ounce pouches has a date-like print ""03 26 13 GB"", but I came across quite a few gone-bad pistachio nuts which you can't tell until you've tasted them.

1	B001BOAOQ4	A36WGHR8TO5DKT	A Permanent Replacement to Other Candies in our House	I decided to try these in the hopes of finding a good organic and sugarless option.  These are wonderful!  I tried both the Pomegranate and Cherry flavors, and like them both.  Instead of sugar, these are sweetened with cane juice.  This adds a very slight flavor note, which enhances the appeal, giving these a bit more complexity and interest than the typical sugary-sweet hard candies.  The fruit flavor is definitely predominant and comes through loud and clear.  These last a long time, don't burn the roof of my mouth (like some hard candies do), and don't seem to get soft and sticky after residing in my purse for a while, like most hard candies do.  These are a standard item in my household now!	2	0

1	B000KV61FC	A2NA7HY1WZP31N	Dog ate the rope, but this thing has endless possibilities!	This toy is great! It keeps my Aussie Cattle Dog engaged and working for her food at every meal, and makes her think and strategize at every angle. She is not known for her patience when it comes to getting food out of toys, and she'll easily shred or rip apart whatever she has to get to the food in the most efficient way possible. Less than 24hours after teaching her how this thing works, she figured out that the rope was keeping the food inside, so she promptly took it to her bed and ate the rope. We were initially disappointed - it was a sturdy cotton rope! Watching her just inhale the food out of it (literally, she would tip it neck-down into her mouth and just pour the food out of it with no rope to stop the food), we decided to put some objects inside the bottle to make it more challenging, since the rope idea seemed to be a little too easy for her. We started with two golf balls, then moved up to two racquette balls, then a tennis ball. The tennis ball is almost impossible for her to get the food because it's so large the food won't move around it, so we went back to the racquette balls. So far, so good. She beats the thing against the floor, throws it into walls, and gnaws on it like it's covered in frozen peanut butter, and it holds up like a dream. She's gone from inhaling her food in under 30 seconds to taking almost 2 full minutes to eat a meal.<br /><br />Other reviews have mentioned flimsy plastic, but we've found our's is great and made of sturdy, thick plastic. So far she's only scratched it a little on the outside. Others have complained of the same rope issues we had - the dog unravels or chews it off. Adding objects inside the toy that help block the food is a very simple, extremely cost-effective way of altering the toy to make it easier or more difficult. We change it up sometimes from the racquette balls to small wood blocks, a variety of smaller objects (plastic Gatorade caps, golf balls, etc) - anything that is too big to come out the neck but large enough to block the food without being impossible. We've started putting it in places she has to work to get to before she can eat from it - on a chair, in an open box, hidden under a pillow on the floor, etc. Not a whole lot of effort on our part, but it pays off in spades when she's mentally tired for an hour or so after dinner!	2	0
-1	B0062A87HA	A3GDZVFRCB4KNN	Farmer's Market is clearly packing dented cans and marketing them through Amazon.com	Like most of the US, our local stores were all out of canned pumpkin and didn't expect any more to be available until after the Fall 2010 harvest.<br /><br />So, I turned to what I thought was a reliable online retailer - Amazon - to fill the gap.<br /><br />I read the other reviews, but not until AFTER I placed the order.  My mistake, I know.<br /><br />I was optimimistic that perhaps I'd be one of the lucky buyers who didn't get any serious dents.  Unfortunately, just like others reported the case came sealed in two boxes.  The inner box was well packed with bubble wrap covering the already sealed case of pumpkin cans.  The cans were dented even in the middle of the sealed case.  They had clearly been packaged this way and not damaged in shipment.  I find it appalling that Farmer's Market is using Amazon.com as a way to sell its dented and damaged product, knowing full well that buyers cannot visually inspect the product prior to purchase.	8	0
1	B0009FHDB0	A2ITY3O2UPJLN8	The best tasking crackers ever.	"This is the best tasting cracker I've ever tasted.  It may cost less in a Filipino or Asian store ... which is all well and good unless you don't live close to one (I don't).  Note that the box says 1 pound 14 ounces - but the description on this page says ""28z"" (whatever a ""z"" is).  If they meant ""oz,"" it's incorrect.  It's a 30oz. box.  In any case, I was able to find it even cheaper online than the price shown on this page.  Where?  Amazon (grin).  Whenever you buy stuff like this, be sure to consider the ""bottom line"" price (product plus shipping) - and check for alternative Amazon pages where it's cheaper.  On this page, it's $15.78 for a 30oz box with free shipping (if you total order is $25 or more).  But on this page:<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0066D2XVY"">SKY FLAKES CRACKERS 1x850G</a><br /><br />the same 30oz box costs only $9.00 + $5.49 shipping ... or $14.49 total, over a dollar cheaper than on this page.

1	B0009XQSAY	A31QQPKAC0WFCZ	Good Product, Good Shelf Life	Received these in March 2012 and the expiration date was August 2013, so I got nearly a year and a half recommended shelf life.<br /><br />The chicken is good quality and is flavorful. Great for chicken tacos, burritos and chicken salad. Quick and easy, I rinse the contents.<br /><br />There is nearly 50 grams (10 grams per serving and the serving size is 2 ounces) of protein in each can which is one reason for selecting this product. I keep a year supply of food on hand and these fit in nicely with my food storage and rotation efforts.<br /><br />I also ordered the Tyson canned chicken and was very pleased to note the Tyson arrived at the same time and has a February 2015 recommended shelf life.

1	B008ZRKZSM	A2IIMX1CS0TIE9	So Good why isn't it Bad???	"After a couple of days to try out these 2 Peanut butter substitutes (the regular and chocolate versions) I can say I'm a convert. I LOVE peanut butter, for me it's a trigger food. If I eat it, I tend to want to eat half the jar at once and it can lead to wanting to eat other things I know I shouldn't. I've worked damn hard to shed 170lb this past year and half and indulging in PB is something I very rarely do anymore. I'd all but given it up. So actually finding something like this, which will allow me to enjoy the occasional PB&J sandwich without the feelings of guilt and remorse is a godsend!<br />The reg. version of PB2 does have a roasted peanut taste to it, so it's not quite like regular PB, you don't get the salty sweeter taste of Jiff or Skippy. JUST the roasted peanut taste. But it's quickly adapted to. And the Chocolate version (which I was more skeptical of) was even better! You can eat either one right after you mix them with water, but I think they're best when added to something else.<br />First of all I like to mix a base of reg PB2 with the chocolate version since I prefer a bit more of the nutty flavor to the chocolate. When just eating the chocolate my first thought was this would be great on whole wheat with a smear of marshmallow creme. And I don't even like marshmallow creme. But I will probably try it out one day to see if I'm right.<br />Either spread works great on fruit. I've tried apples and bananas so far. I also tried a PB&J with reduced calorie jelly and it worked very well. Good enough to replace the high calorie reg. PB&J sandwiches.<br /><br />It might sound strange but one combo I REALLY like is to scoop a bit of the powdered PB onto a fat free potato chip (I use Pringles fat free sour cream) and no there wasn't a taste clash or anything. I'm sure you could use the reg Pringles fat free, I just happen to think the sour cream ones taste better. Anyway turn the chip upside down and scoop a bit of powder into the ""bowl"" of the underside and eat. The salt of the chip is the first thing that hits your tongue and then the PB powered crumbs. And the combo is just....yumm!!!! Like that, it really does taste like any PB you could buy. I tried it with the chocolate version too, and there it's really like eating a peanut butter cup. And surprisingly the salty chip and powered PB isn't dry in the mouth. Quite the opposite actually. Now on the other hand, I tried adding the powdered PB2 as a topping to my skinny cow ice cream as I do on occasion like some melted PB on my ice cream, but there it DID dry out my mouth completely. Very strange. So I decided to try and mix the PB2 with water then heat it up in the microwave to see if it would melt like reg PB. It didn't. It got hot, but ended up dry like the cookie dough for peanut butter cookies where you can basically ball it up in your hands. I guess without all the fat the PB2 can't melt like standard peanut butter. So as for ice cream topping, at least so far, it hasn't worked.<br />I am looking forward to seeing what else these 2 powdered products would work with and am already planning on ordering the larger sizes as I'd like to try some baking with them too.<br /><br />All in all, I highly recommend them!<br /><br />Edit; Okay so it DOES work as a melted peanut butter substitute on ice cream. The key is to start with a base of water and gradually add powder to it until you get a very creamy consistency that will run off a spoon, just like melted pb *then* heat it up in the microwave. My first attempt with this method I used far too much water so be careful there. I kept adding bits of powder including the chocolate version for fear I'd use all my pb2 up. But it was so much water I couldn't thicken it up enough and decided to start over. However, rather than just throw it all out, I decided to try it out as a drink. And you know, heated up, it was like a super rich cup of cocoa....delish! Even with no added sweetener it was sweet enough. And as a plus, since it's just water you can save those calories there. Not to mention, if you're lactose intolerant like me, regular hot chocolate is out anyway.<br /><br />Now even though this stuff is 85% less than regular peanut butter it does have some calories and fat, so I wouldn't over do it. But as an occasional indulgence, I'm so happy I found this!<br /><br />PS: I just want to add since purchasing PB2 from Amazon I've found a site called ""netrition.com"" and I highly recommend buying food stuffs from them. Amazon is great for pretty much everything else, but they are way over priced on their food.<br />I bought the large 16oz pack of PB2 from netrition for only 7.99 per bag. the same price Amazon charges for the small 6.5oz size! They don't have free shipping like Amazon, but they only charge $4.95 flat shipping fee no matter how much you buy. So it's not bad. Maybe because I bought so much, or it was my first time ordering but they also sent me a free low cal. quick cook cake mix. They were also way WAY cheaper on PB2 peanut butter crackers and everything else I ordered from them.<br /><br />So like I said, Amazon is great for most things, but when it comes to food. Netrition is a whole lot better!"	2	0

This is a lovely gift-<br />highly appreciated. Keeps for months (keep it cool, OK in fridge).<br /><br />Niederegger Marzipan is like no other! Search them on the web for the full story. Highest quality Marzipan originated in Turkey, under the Ottomans. When the Turks came up through Europe, all the way to the Gates of Vienna, they brought Marzipan with them. -The Croissant bread (Turkish Crescent)  was developed to warn people the Turks were coming-<br /><br />The Germans, Swiss, Austrians, and Swedes are most renowned for Marzipan in Europe. Check out the Niederegger site -a nice site! Great site-learn about Marzipan quickly-nice story.<br /><br />Niederegger Marzipan is made with more Almonds, less sugar, filler than others. Simply, ground almonds, rose water, sugar make the best Marzipan.  No filler, no almond extracts.<br />Lower quality Marzipans need that since they have a lower concentration of almonds.<br /><br />With WWII, the Cafe Niederegger in Lubeck, Germany (East Germany for many years) was destroyed: 1942 ""The caf&eacute; was destroyed by bombing and the company's archives went up in flames.""<br /><br />Thankfully, the cafe  was rebuilt & this fine Marzipan is still available. With German reunification, it is easier to get this great marzipan again. Highly recommended!"	3	0
-1	B004ZIER34	A2WVF9ZQ068DN0	Disappointing	"This is a difficult review to write.  I have reflux and coffee is a major trigger.  I LOVE good coffee, dark, strong, robust coffee.<br /><br />I was so happy to find this product and had hoped I could ""have my coffee and drink it, too.""  It is not to be.  I would rather have nothing than drink this.<br /><br />Coffee is such a personal thing.  I know most people drink it because they are addicted to caffeine (otherwise there would be NO on buying the majority of the coffee sold in grocery stores).  I drink coffee because I absolutely love the taste (I normally drink decaf everything so caffeine is not a factor for me).<br /><br />For those who absolutely cannot have coffee and aren't particular about flavor, I think this product will be a godsend.  Just like the gluten free products are godsends for celiacs, but you won't catch me eating them either!"	1	0

1	B00503DP0O	AK7CAW3N1XZV6	Very tasty, but not really a health food	"Because they are both gluten-free and wheat-free, these soft, chewy bars seem to be trying to masquerade as health food.  In truth, however, these ""bars"" are barely distinguishable from cookies--perhaps a slightly more wholesome version, as they are relatively low in sugar (8 grams) and filled with other beneficial ingredients (e.g., 180 mg Omega 3s, 9 grams of whole grains, and 2 grams each of fiber/protein).<br /><br />BUT, being a cookie bar isn't necessarily a bad thing!  Although each bar is a bit high in calories/fat (180/9 grams), especially for the smallish size, the individual packaging of the bars assists with portion control.  And perhaps more importantly, the taste of these bars is excellent!  As promised, they are moist and chewy, very similar to a cookie that you would purchase from a bakery (or even something homemade).  Biting into the bar, you can taste flakes of coconut, pieces of nut, and small bits of chocolate.  Overall, these were definitely a yummy treat!<br /><br />I suspect that these bars will mainly appeal to those looking for gluten-free snacks, but others will enjoy this product as well."	0	0

1	B002QWP89S	A2ST78JTMA1OUM	It's like crack for dogs...	First some history:<br />Our dog can't chew rawhide bones.  She has a habit of breaking off pieces & swallowing them whole.  We have had problems with blockages & constipation as a result -- everytime she has received a rawhide.<br /><br />We have a 13 yr old Beagle which was introduced to Greenies about 2 yrs ago.  We were given a couple of the Large ones from a friend to try.  Through carelessness on our part, our dog destroyed both large treats within 15 minutes.  When we found her, we were scared figuring she would die from swallowing this large plasticky looking treat.  We quickly did some web searches & found out that the newer formula is supposed to dissolve rather easily with water.  After making sure she drank a good amount of water, we monitored her activity.  In the end, she had no problems & we were able to find a treat that is more chewable than your biscuit type treats, but safer than rawhide (at least for her).  We have tried many different treats & toys, but have NEVER had the type of response that we get from giving her a Greenie.  It seriously is like crack for dogs...	15	1

-1	B0002TJAZK	A2ISKAWUPGGOLZ	Kitty Junk Food	We have five cats - one an elderly cat of 15 years, the other four in the 9-11 year range.  The oldest cat was diagnosed a couple of months ago with the beginning stages of chronic kidney disease.  His numbers didn't warrant being on prescription food yet, but we needed to start paying attention to things like protein and phosphorus levels in his food.  Because we have five cats, and some of them are nibblers eating four or five nuggets at a time, we decided to switch them all to an acceptable food for the oldest, so we picked the active longevity because it specifically mentioned kidney support and calories appropriate for less active older cats.<br /><br />Since we made the switch 6 weeks ago, all of the cats have gained weight.  This was fine for the little old guy as he was a bit underweight; not good for the rest of them.  Our other male went from a slightly chunky 18.5 lbs to an obese 21.25 lbs - almost three pounds in 6 weeks!  The 3 females gained between 1.5 to 2 pounds each.  We noticed them making a lot more visits to the food bowl, like they couldn't seem to get full.  We also saw a lessening of coat quality - lots of shedding even though they are brushed regularly (including with a furminator) and one developed bad dandruff.  The stools developed a really bad odor, although I do have to say nobody developed diarrhea which I am grateful for.  Most worrisome was that the lab results on the old guy came back with some of the kidney values of concern having worsened.<br /><br />I am very disgusted with Science Diet - they are actively fooling the public with the nutritional claims on the bags. One of the sites I researched on for chronic renal failure has charts detailing the nutritional breakdown of most of the various foods available.  If you compare the various Science diet formulae that have different health claims on them - the nutritional values for the components listed are all within a tenth of a point or two.  Basically from the nutritional analysis it appears that they are  the same base formula with maybe a slight difference in a vitamin or additive.  With other brands, such as innova or royal canin, there appears to be an actual difference between the different formulae.<br /><br />Now to deal with the weight gain, as well as the other problems we noted, we are switching foods again.  This time we are trying royal canin indoor mature.  Wish us luck.	2	2

That stuff is a neurotoxin and I'm suffering from some of the long-term health effects of that poison.  I had high hopes for beverages using the new Stevia extract and tried the Other brand with the Stevia ingredient.  The other brand is a little pricey, so I thought I would try this one too. The other brand, outside of the price was a very pleasant experience.  Keeping in mind that this is the only flavor I tried of this brand,  I can't comment on the Blue Sky brand as a whole, but in this one instance, I have to say it sucks.  The initial taste in unpalatable and the after-taste is even worse.  I tried six cans over the course of a week (hoping my taste would acclimate)  and ended up pouring the rest down the drain.  It doesn't taste like a beverage.  I'm not sure what the taste reminds me of, but I definitely cant drink it.  Sorry for the harsh review, but this stuff is awful.	3	3

1	B008ZRKZSM	A1GZ78UDJTWBFS	Great Product...awful price on Amazon	Agree with other reviewers that PB2 is twice as expensive on Amazon so definitely shop around for better deals.  The texture of PB2, when mixed according to directions, is similar to natural peanut butter.  I add an extra 1-2 tsps of water to get a fluffier creamier texture and it doesn't water down the flavor.  It's not bad as a PB substitute and I really wasn't expecting it to be identical to the real thing.  The texture and mouthfeel isn't as satisfying as the real PB, but the flavor is fantastic.  It works best when used as a flavoring agent or substitute rather than eaten as simply a spoon full of PB. I will definitely buy more but from another seller that offers it at a fair price and with very reasonable shipping fees.	5	0
1	B000E671W0	A26A64X86VL1R4	Refreshing and wholesome!	"This is Celestial Seasonings at their best-a plump bag of fresh tasty peppermint leaf, which brews up to a clean delicious cup of tea! Peppermint is one of the most enjoyable herbal teas with a naturally sweet, clean taste.<br /><br />Peppermint is an herb that has many uses in traditional herbal medicine. It is reputed to relax the muscles of the digestive system which helps relieve nausea. Peppermint combats flatulence, promotes bile flow and digestive juices, and has a mildly anesthetic effect which also eases indigestion. It is supposed to relieve anxiety and tension, soothe headaches and calm symptoms associated with the menstrual cycle.<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don't package each tea bag individually. Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag. The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface.<br /><br />Quote from the box:<br /><br />""Beauty is not in the face; beauty is a light in the heart.""

1	B001EPQQL2	A19NP8YYADOOSF	Part of my greek yogurt breakfast	"My morning breakfast:<br /><br />A six-ounce container of Fage 2% plain Greek Yogurt, mixed with a sliced banana and 3 or 4 sliced strawberries.  Add a teaspoon of Splenda Brown Sugar Blend, and it's nicely sweetened, and a healthy way for me to start my day.  I started this breakfast routine over a year ago, and haven't grown tired of it.  It was suggested at a Weight Watchers meeting as a very ""low points"" breakfast.  It has easily become my ""standard"" for breakfast...so much so that I will bring a bag of Splenda with me on vacations, in case I have trouble finding it at the store.  (I also openly admit that perhaps I'm too hung up on this routine.  But it's so satisfying in the morning that I don't care.)<br /><br />I haven't personally ever cooked with this brown sugar blend, but as a topping on my yogurt or a baked sweet potato, it's been great!"	0	0
1	B003V8Y5F4	A1BGRREOYFWOA0	These are wonderful!!!!	I enjoy popcorn, so when I saw these on Amazon I thought I would give them a try.  WOW!

1	B001EQ54M8	A2S6RZBC13UD7O	Java Jive	This is my fave Starbuck's coffee.  So I used a $25 gift certificate.  In these troubled times buying food instead of CD's or other crap seemed like a good adult idea. Of course I still go to the actual store to meet friends and get so buzzed on caffeine I can't concentrate.  But hey, that's the point!	2	1

1	B000I200NW	A1FFKT4NEFW0P0	My boyfriend LOVES this hot chocolate!!!	Every year for Christmas I have given my boyfriend different gourmet brands of hot chocolate as stocking stuffers. However three years ago I got Bellagio hot chocolate and that is the ONLY brand he wants. He especially loves the caramel praline and the chocolate truffle. They are smooth and wonderful in warm/hot milk! It's never an over whelming or under whelming flavor. Always delicious. Whether you are sipping it reading a book or having it with friends after a great meal. I highly recommend it!!!	0	0
1	B001RVFDOO	A2UY5TRWQ8SLFC	Excellent 2 thumbs up !!!!	Amazing concept... not fried, not even baked... Popped like Popcorn... !!!!<br />This is another product for my Weight Watchers regima.

This is my first experience with Master of Mixes, and the Manhattans turned out great, just as good as if I had made them from scratch. A great product!	0	0

The product is not only loved by my precious babies, but it does not smell bad, it is easy to store and handle, and makes a difference in the way they feel.  One of my dogs has some hip problems, I have noticed a difference in the way he gets around.  Truly a WONDERFUL product.

1	B000K8ESBO	A2VE9NSEK4EQFF	Delicious!	This product is very satisfying if you crave French<br />vanilla flavor without calories. I use two tablets in a mug of coffee & it is perfect for me.

-1	B000QUZ9DC	AK8CO0R1HB491	not that great	Gum sticks to my teeth and flavor doesn't last long at all.  It's ok for vending machine gum and it was a decent price but the gum itself is not that good.	0	0
-1	B001LXYA5Q	AUK7N7CQXUQX4	Not Impressed	My husband and I were excited to try them. We bought pineapple, beer, lemon, lime, hot peppers, cheese and wine. The only thing we noticed any difference in was the lemon and lime. The lemon was pretty easy to eat because it added some sweetness - it remained quite sour though. We each let one tablet dissolve on our tongue as directed so not sure what the problem was.	2	3

1	B000YSS7EO	A58F10T4OE58C	DHA and probiotics puts this cereal way above others	Dr Sears knows babies, and his recommendation of this product went a long way in our decision to purchase it.  At first we were making our own rice cereal out of organic ground brown rice, but of course couldn't add the DHA and probiotics.  Our baby gets those through breastmilk, but it is nice to be able to supplement with the cereal.<br /><br />It is very easy to mix and use, and tastes good.  Much easier than making your own, and way better than any of the Gerber products.  I'd recommend any of the HappyBellies products.	1	0
1	B000GWHFZA	A2ETJVGN7YWK0M	Cavender's All Purpose Salt Free Greek Seasong	I used Cavenders Greek seasoning for the first time several years ago when my sister sent me 2-8 oz. containers as part of a birthday gift.  It is one of the best, most useful and prolific gifts I have ever received.  I use this seasoning on chicken, beef, pork and seafood dishes and in soups and stews as well.  This is one of the best seasonings I have ever used.  I refuse to cook without it. I use the salt free Cavenders as often as I use the Cavenders with salt.  Whatever your choice,I suggest that everyone who wants to pump up the flavor of their foods try this seasoing and like me, you will make it a staple in your household.	3	0

1	B0075LFKRK	A1KJH3PK610TT6	This is excellent	I love fresh squeezed grapefruit juice. Most grapefruit drinks just don't taste like the real thing. I saw a 6-pack of San Pellegrino Pompelmo at the local Fresh Market and thought I'd give it a try. After having several cans, I have to say it is terrific. It is made with 16% grapefruit juice and, unlike most other grapefruit drinks, has a genuine grapefruit flavor. If you like their Limonata and also like grapefruit juice, I think you will enjoy this.	1	0
1	B003SC0QBK	A2SS44O400KIZ7	Great	This  is the best tasting Tuna I have ever ate. It has a rich quality to it. I would have no doubts about recommending this to anyone. I will be ordering more.	6	0

-1	B002SW9J8W	A19G8B2QYETD7W	Great if you like your chocolate with a side of body lotion	I bought this candy on a whim because I love pretty much all things coconut. I figured it would taste like a m&m's version of an almond joy minus the almonds, but was much disappointed. It tasted like an overly sweet waxy coconut body lotion, with a hint of chocolate and candy shell. UTTERLY DISGUSTING. Too late, i noticed on the ingredients list there was no coconut at all to be found--it's all artificial flavoring.<br />I had to throw the bag away.	3	1
-1	B000UVKZXQ	A21CVM7Z4KBBWC	Galil Roasted Chestnuts	Ok, I read the awful reviews but I am such a chestnut lover that I knew I would not have a problem. This product looks like a chestnut. BUT the taste and texture is AWFUL and I gagged. It should not be allowed for sale. DO NOT BUY!	1	1
-1	B0078Y6OX8	A116MBJQU5SC8W	Very artificial flavor	I was looking forward to this flavor. I don't tend to like a very strong brew, but a nice light coffee flavor with a touch a vanilla is something I enjoy. This coffee was awful. The coffee reminded me of cheap Folgers with some international delights creamer thrown in. Typically that grosses me out, it's so artificial tasting and that is what I got with this. Glad it was just one in a variety pack and I didn't have money wasted. I think I'll stick to a good regular brew and add my own vanilla.	0	0
1	B0049D7JQW	A24SNRT3P4Q71L	Packed in cooler & delivered quickly	"I LOVE TWIX MINIS because they are the perfect size. I have bought, and LOVE ALL 3 of the different size ""TWIX MINIS"" packages that are either sold by Amazon, or ""Fulfilled"" by Amazon (compared to the other merchants), because they always come in a small white 6 pack size Styrofoam cooler with ice packs. I can't remember if they always came like that, or if it's just in the summer that they use the cooler, but they have always been packaged well. I have Amazon Prime so whenever they have them on sale, and they are ""Prime 2 day Free shipping"" eligible, I get them in 2 or 3 days , or it takes 4-5 days at other times."	0	0

It was a quick way to get them a hot breakfast on a busy morning and still get them to school on time. They started refusing to eat it, and would leave their bowls mostly full and uneaten. They said it tasted ""funny"". I tried a bite, and sure enough. I thought it had spoiled, so threw out the whole box, and bought a ""fresh"" box next time I was at the store. Nope, the flavor was terrible in the new box as well. Bad, bad move, Quaker. Go back to the old flavor formulas before you lose this line of business altogether."	4	0
1	B005VOOQLO	A91K8PFC5I5R6	Pretty darn good...	"Being something of an energy drink junkie, I was eager to try this out and see what it tasted like.  ""Green Thunder""? What exactly does that mean..?  My first impression was somewhere between Monster or Mountain Dew, with the sweet tart-ish flavor of Red Bull (even if the radioactive green color is a little unsettling).  Pretty good overall!!  Hard to believe it's zero calorie... I think it tastes great and usually end up putting in more than the two squirts that are recommended. I'm hoping I can use this to wean myself off of Red Bull, seeing as it's much cheaper and waaay lower in calories. In my opinion, Mio has done it again. $4/bottle isn't too bad a price; it's approximately what I can find in grocery stores."	1	0
-1	B0006VB3TA	A2T66Z9VGCWXQA	Everlasting? uhhhhhh NO	"These are decent treats to keep your dog busy for a while, but if the word ""everlasting"" is what's making you consider buying...move on.  I have two german shepherds.  They aren't mega chewers but enjoy a treat.  These things last about 10mins MAX with them.  I have two types of ""holders"" for the treats and the dogs manage to crack the treat part in a minute or two then just gnaw on it for a few more minutes until its done.  For the price they are asking on these, definitely get something else."	0	0
1	B00008JOL0	A1JDN4KOD1K2C	Great supplement that my dog asks for	My elderly lab suffers from arthritis.  Her pain is greatly diminished by taking glucosamine and chondroitin.  Unfortunately she is not a fan of the gravy, chewable tablets or pill forms.  Hip Action has been a fantastic find because she actually wants her meds.  You can set a clock by her these days at 8 pm she goes into the kitchen and stares at the cupboard where we store the Hip Action and waits for her two treats.	0	0
1	B007TJGZ54	A11VBIBJ5LWVP8	Perfect light blend.	I've purchased K-cups in a variety of blends and have learned that the batch to batch consistency isn't perfect.  But unlike some of the reviews of Green Mountain Breakfast Blend I've never had a bad batch of this blend.  If you enjoy a light roast this one seems perfect to me.  It is  available in both regular and decaf.  And for extra savings you may want to order the 50 count box from Amazon which is only $0.60/cup now.	0	0

What I opened this morning was not what I had expected. To be clear, I was greatly dissapointed. I found bits of husk from the bean, which doesn't make coffee, and is considered filler. The flavor left something to be desired as well, it tasted like folgers coffee without all the acid. I was hoping to leave a great review of this product, but honesty forbids it.	0	1

With the holidays coming around I became so busy I was unable to get my fix so I broke down and bought a machine for my home that was approximately $230.00 here on Amazon.

-1	B004ECVRNO	A2FBCSL9BUDS51	This is nasty!!! Even if you like pepper on your sandwich! Beware!	I totally agree with the reviewer who said this mayo is wayyy to hot!! I bought this mayo for my boyfriend who loves pepper with his sandwiches. I was alittle skeptical because I like pepper but not alot. So I reluctantly bought this because I really like the regular olive oil mayo.<br />I was the first one to try this mayo. I had made me a club sandwich with turkey, turkey bacon, avocado, tomatoes, green leaf lettuce and then this mayo... The only thing I tasted was this mayo!!! It overpowered the whole sandwich. I didnt even use that much either... I was starving so I choked down this sandwich. Then I sat and drank, drank, drank some more just to get the pepper out of my mouth!! This was horrible...<br />Then I gave some to my boyfriend to try and he spit it out!! He was like man what are you trying to do, poison me with pepper! I told him that is the mayo you had me buy with the cracked pepper in it. He said throw that jar away and get the regular olive oil mayo. This stuff is nasty!!<br />I understand that everyone has their own opinion of food but this is really hot and overpowering with pepper. Like one reviewer said that it has cracked pepper in it so why would you buy it if you dont like pepper. I like pepper and my boyfriend loves pepper but this went in the trash!	1	2

1	B002JWZVWO	ATIN6PG2LSHM8	Wow and YUM!	We LOVE this stuff around my house.  I finally got my husband to switch from his sugary sports drinks to a healthy option.  His favorite is the Pink Guava.  I like it because it has a ton of potassium and other minerals that hydrate me well which is important as I am a full time fitness instructor.  It also satisfies my sweet cravings without being sugary or doing crazy things to my blood sugar.  I'm sure kids will love it as well.  A much better option than a Sunny whatever juice box.  It is perfect for a packed lunch.  FIVE STARS! I'd give it more if I could.  The Mango flavor of this brand is also wonderful and the unflavored is a favorite as well.  I enjoy it more than other brands (and I've tried quite a few).  O.N.E. is by far my favorite.	0	0

I tried the Dark Breakfast from Gevalia, but it's horrible.  I can only drink it after adding the Maestro Lorenzo Espresso Intensivo.  That makes quite a nice cup with a good kick to it.  I even need a little cream in it to smooth it out a bit.<br /><br />But this one is just right.  It's a nice strong cup that doesn't need cream, but can take cream without losing flavor.  This is the first hope I have had for saving my Tassimo machine.  I don't want to go back to the Keurig.<br /><br />p.s.  I would still like a good decaf option.

-1	B000EPP56U	AJSTGUC7GWMWD	Wrong product	I ordered Ka-me rice crunch crackers, plain. I received Ka-me gluten-free rice crackers, original, all natural.  Unfortunately, they have soy products in this cracker and therefore I can't eat it.  This looks different from the picture that came with the crackers I ordered.  Apparently I can't return the box of crackers.	0	7
1	B002T9GRNO	A25KJ3W2EOJYZ4	Delicious!	My baby loves this food: I've tasted it myself, and it has a very nice flavor. I love that it is made with brown rice instead of white rice for better nutrition. I prefer to make my own food, but this is really nice as a back up when things get busy or for travel.	0	0

1	B000FF3E2Q	A1NLVBX9PY8HLJ	wonderful tea, works great	I usually never leave any reviews but since the product is worthy and there's no feedback at all I decided to do it. I ordered this tea because I have some mastopathy and my breasts hurt much during my cycle. Things seemed to get a bit worse a couple months ago so I decided to give this tea a try. I come from a country where there is a lot of trust in herbal medicine, I personally was exposed to Chinese herbal medicine as well so I thought I should try. I drank it for about a month once per day and I already see results! During this cycle my breasts got much better, almost not sensitive at all, just a bit by the very end of it. I will continue drinking it and will recommend it to all my girlfriends with the same problems. It is natural, it doesn't contain any hormones and it DOES work. It tastes very much like regular green tea with jasmine(because it has a small portion of both of them) and that's why I don't recommend to drink it before going to bed because it can keep you up( green tea has a bit of caffeine, a tiny portion). I drink it either in the morning or at  lunch time, it tastes good and helps you to wake up( and unlike coffee, green tea doesn't damage your kidneys).	0	0
1	B000OF71Y4	A1YPRLAFZLSAS0	Great for a convenient cup of coffee!	I have a small single cup coffee maker for those times when I need a quick cup of coffee but don't want a whole pot.  All right, that doesn't happen very often - I can usually handle a whole pot.  But when I want a quick cup, I don't want to be grinding beans, getting out a filter and going through all the same steps as making a whole pot.  These filter packs are the perfect solution at a great price!  The coffee is almost as good as Starbucks for a fraction of the price.	6	0
-1	B000YSS7EO	A1A8KMDICRUFPT	The cereal is stale	I baught this kind of cereal from Wholefood. Since this was the first time I tried this brand, I picked 3 kinds: multi-grain, oatmeal and brown rice. Oatmeal was all right, but the other two smelled like they were already stale(the expiration day is May 2013), and they tasted bad too and sticked on my throat when I tried them. My baby cried and refused to eat them. The customer service of Wholefood was very nice and refunded me. I don't think I will buy this brand of cereal again.	1	0

Little did I know I would get hooked on the delicious movie theater taste, with none of the fat issues of other brands!

1	B0010OOM1S	A17HMM1M7T9PJ1	Mushroomy goodness!	"I have been a fan of the More Than Gourmet product line for many years (I think since right about when they started) and this stock reduction is one of my favorites. Unlike their duck, chicken, veal, lamb and seafood products, this one can be added to almost anything. Soups, stews, sauces, what have you. This will add depth to all of the other More Than Gourmet stocks and glaces.<br /><br />They start with a classic ""essence de champignon"" (which is a mushroom stock containing sherry, salt, garlic and spices) and then they reduce it to 1/20 of it's volume. Since it is bound with a starch (Tapioca) it will help to add some body to a sauce. It can be used minimally diluted and poured over carrots, fish (really just about anything that would taste good with mushrooms), or added to an existing sauce or dish.<br /><br />I often make my own mayonnaise using safflower oil, egg yolks, Dijon mustard, lemon juice and various seasonings. I usually serve it as an elegant topping for fish or vegetables (it's great on asparagus) but I always thought that it could be better. I now add just a teaspoon of the More than Gourmet Essence De Champignon Gold and I can't believe how much better it is!<br /><br />I am a lifelong carnivore but some members of my family are vegetarians. When I cook for them I substitute this for a veal, chicken or beef demi-glace. I even add it to vegetable stock to give it that extra dimension. Sometimes I buy it in the 16 oz. tub, other times I like the convenience of the small 1.5 oz cups. If you can think of a dish that would would benefit from the hearty, earthy flavor of mushrooms then I recommend that you give this a try."	0	0
-1	B001AJ1ULS	A3IXMFF7SJGBHP	Dogswell Happy Hips for Dogs, Beef Liver	I placed an order for Dogswell Happy Hips for Dogs, Beef Liver on 6/25/12.  On July 5 when my current supply was used up, I opened the new batch.  Started with one pouch and then a second pouch.  For the first time the product doesn't appear to be healthy and fresh.  Instead of being solid brown, hard and crispy, the beef liver pieces are soft, pliable and some have a whitish powdery covering on them.  I'm afraid to feed these to  my dogs or other dogs that I meet in the park.  I've been buying this product for years and this is the first time it doesn't look and feel right.  I'm going to try to get an exchange hoping that this is just a bad batch.  One thing I did notice when the package arrived and that is the long, tall plastic bag was substituted with a horizontal short bag that didn't fit the 6 pouches very well.  My guess is that another manufacturer is making this dog treat, not the original one and that's the reason for the inferior and unhealthy quality of the treats.	1	0

1	B000PDY3P0	A2M9LGDZY5UMXX	Buy this popcorn - no really...buy it.	I can't say enough good stuff about this popcorn.  It is the best tasting popcorn I've ever had. I've ordered it twice (both times from Amazon) and have not been disappointed by it in any way.  After popping, there are very few unpopped kernels and it comes prepackaged with just the right amount of salt.  The oil gives it a unique taste.  If you have a 4oz popper, buy this popcorn.  It is simply amazing.	3	0
1	B001CGTN1I	A1QXIB5SJG07XP	They are amazing	Read one of the chia books out there. This really is a super food.<br /><br />The only down side is the price gouging here on Amazon. Chia can now be found in many grocery stores in the bulk bins for around $9.50/lb. $20/bag here is ridiculous.	1	0
1	B002OFZIV0	A41L0PDLK9BB2	Tasty, Lean, and Insanely Addictive	Little morsels of moist, pure beef that taste like high quality roast.  I got the Teriyaki by accident - I normally don't like teriyaki ANYTHING - but the only hint of added flavoring on these is a little sweetness.<br /><br />Lean, good cuts of meat with no nasty little gristley surprises.

-1	B000LRH7HG	A2J8ID5U61YGT9	Have ordered before but this shipment was unusable	"The 4 pounds of sliced meat itself are contained in a single cardboard box; no vacuum seal or even plastic wrap.  That box is placed in another box that is lined with styrofoam sides, styrofoam peanuts, and three frozen ""ice"" paks.  It was shipped FedEx 2 Day (that's what the label says), not Overnight or next business day, which begs the question, what exactly did the $52 in shipping charges for 4 lbs of meat and minimal packing materials actually go towards?  I think I know, and it wasn't shipping.<br /><br />Years ago ""Grecian Delight"" (the brand on the box) was sold in a local supermarket chain in Gyro Kit boxes - each contained a pack of sliced gyro meat, one pita, and a small container of tzatziki sauce.  I loved them, but I haven't seen the kits in decades and was happy to find a way to once again stock the freezer with gyros-in-waiting.<br /><br />The gyro meat itself, which I have ordered before, tastes just like ... gyro meat!  As I said, I love gyros, but there's no place nearby where I can drop in and enjoy one.  So I have ordered the product in the past, but in this case, I've ordered for the last time.<br /><br />I've gotten the individual 1 lb vacuum packets before 3 at a time and they've arrived frozen or nearly frozen. Not so this box.  The meat was not only thawed, it was only slightly cool. I'm afraid I'm going to be throwing it out.  Too risky.  For $52 shipping charges, it should have arrived in perfect condition. Overnight. I won't make this mistake again.  I can't afford to."	0	0
-1	B0013NUGDE	A39H72H8NPM0R	Family loved them but this is MY review	I have to be upfront and tell you my family loves these but I do not. I do not like baked Lays or Pringles either. This product reminded me of them, not the same but similar. My son wanted me to try them and then invest in the company. I am glad so many people like them but I will pass on eating them and it looks like it is a private company.... So no stock either.	0	1
1	B0002Z9BF8	A383XURHVF8ON6	I feel good about giving these treats to my pups	These are a hit with my pups, and for the price and 3 calories a piece, they can't be beat!  They're great for training in addition to putting them into food puzzle toys to keep them occupied.  I also provide a steady supply of these to my youngest pup during nail clipping as he has quite a bit of anxiety and these treats totally take his mind off of the scary clipper at his toes.<br /><br />First ingredient is wheat flour, so if your dog happens to be allergic to wheat these won't work for you.  My dogs aren't allergic, nor do these treats give tummy problems, so I'm happy!  Ingredient list is short, that's another plus, it's not a long list of artificial this and that.<br /><br />I give my pups both the liver flavor and the cheese/egg flavor to mix things up a bit.  The cheese/egg ones even smell like cheese, yum!	1	0

1	B000LRIGJE	A3I0ZP2CTZBPOH	awesome snack for young and old	I first heard of jaffa cakes while reading the Gold Box forum. I was pleasantly surprised when we opened one box, they are wonderful! These are angelfood type cookies with a thin layer of a tasty marmalade, all covered with a delicious dark chocolate coating. You taste each distinctive flavor all at once. We bought 2 boxes and managed to make them last 4 days (not easy considering how light they are) and tried them with coffee, hot tea and milk. All good but my preference is the hot tea. A great afternoon treat.<br />The only drawback is that you pay shipping per box and the shipping is higher than the cookies, but still worth it.	3	1
1	B000BF54MS	AASKM93JZX6II	Delicious, mild and versatile	I am too wimpy for spicy foods, so often rely on this chili. It's not bland, though, don't get me wrong.<br /><br />I can serve this to non-vegetarian friends (though I'm honest with them about its soy meat substitute content) and they love it! A couple friends will add some Tabasco but otherwise nobody tinkers with it.<br /><br />I've used this as chili with sour cream, on tostadas, as part of a Sloppy Joe, and even as a dip for crackers.<br /><br />The sodium content is a bit high but I'll take the tradeoff. It makes a wonderfully comforting hot meal on a cold fall or winter evening.<br /><br />Kids like this chili too!<br /><br />I generally serve two to three people with each can.<br /><br />It's also good with cornbread.	3	0

-1	B0062A87HA	A3LFZ77WA9XVYT	Rejects????	I ordered the case of twelve.  Every single can is dented...badly dented.  Were these rejects from a grocery store?  I do not buy dented cans in the grocery store, and I was not at all happy to receive an entire case of dented cans.  The packaging was fine, so the cans had to be dented before they were packed.  I am rethinking Amazon's subscription service for food items.  There is no savings if the product is virtually unusable.  Unfortunately, I cannot comment on the actual product because of the condition the cans arrived in.	1	0

-1	B003DKY5R8	A3RXYQRTJT1V4R	This is terrible tea	This is a really easy way to make terrible iced tea.  Sometimes convenience outweighs taste, but not always.  What this product doesn't tell you before you buy it is that the ingredients are: black tea with tea extract, hibiscus and citric acid.  It's not just tea.  And it doesn't taste like just tea, either.  It tastes like powdered iced tea from a jar.  It has an overtaste of lemon -- that's probably the citric acid.  And that fake tea flavor that comes from powdered iced tea mix.  I'll probably drink it when it's really convenient.  But I won't serve it to friends!  And I won't drink it if I have time to make a glass of real tea and pour it over ice.	1	1

It is also my mother's favorite and she is very direct with her hints that it's time for me to send her some when her stock gets low.<br /><br />I read a review that someone thought the Bellagio brand had a chemical taste.

-1	B000ER6YO0	A2U138G3VKRZSL	Baby loves it, but there is plastic in it	This is my daughter's  most favorite baby food by far.  This is the only ones she'll eat and rarely will eat the other kinds.  However, the taste is very bland, for me as an adult at least. After you put the unfinished portion in the fridge, it may become sort of watery at which point I throw it out. It is unique from the others in the combination of vegetables it has, especially zucchini.<br />I had to update my review today, because I saw little pieces of thin stretchy plastic in two jars of this baby food.

1	B000SATIZA	A997PUM414JUE	Brew With Stevia, Drink instead of Soda	"I use the hibiscus flower tea thus:<br /><br />In a slightly larger than two quart (half gallon) container place 3/4 to 1 cup hibiscus flowers and 3/4-1 tablespoon dried stevia leaves.<br /><br />Add two quarts of boiling water.<br /><br />Let sit for at least 10 minutes.  Drink some hot (if you like).  When it is cool, strain through a fine sieve or mesh into a refrigerator container and enjoy cold.<br /><br />My daughters (12 & 14) enjoy drinking this cold over ice instead of soda and take it to school in the morning in their water bottles.  I drink it cold after running, working in the yard, or going to the gym as it is extraordinarily refreshing cold.  It also tends to keep me from snacking between meals.  We go through about 2-3 gallons/week, mostly cold.<br /><br />Other recommendations:  It stains, so pour it over the sink or something that won't stain.  It is very convenient online, but can also be purchased from many local Mexican markets from the same section as dried peppers.  Consider keeping in a sealed container (I use Lock & Lock) for freshness and to keep from getting wet (again because it will stain). Stevia leaves are not the same as Stevia powder (the powder is much stronger).<br /><br />update:<br />I've used the ""Frontier Bulk Stevia Herb Powder(Green), CERTIFIED ORGANIC, 1 lb. package"" from Amazon instead of the dried stevia leaves from my garden. While brewing 1/2 gallon (2 quarts) of tea, I still used 1 cup of dried hibiscus flowers and 1 level teaspoon of stevia herb powder. Tastes the same as when I use the dried leaves from my garden.  Note:  green stevia powder is not the same as stevia extract."	1	0
-1	B003N8XO3Q	AXYPMWP12U2NT	How did this ever get to market?	These things taste so bad, I could not find anyone in my office who would finish one ON A BET!  They are absolutely foul.  I can't for the life of me figure out how any company would have put these on the market.  when you open them, they smell like pudding, which is a good thing except for when you actually taste them and then you feel like you've been tricked.  They have almost no taste, and the texture of melted plastic.  Another way to describe them is that it is like easting grease, except I think eating grease might be better.  And don't think the chocolate ones will be marginally better.  Snack Pack, shame on you.	1	1

It makes low calorie, whole-grain muffins moist and the recipes require less oil.	0	0

1	B0009F3SAU	ASP630Y4HQ8OO	New Love	I had been reading about echinacea for ages, but I finally decided to try it when I got sick. In addition to drinking tons of water, resting and taking vitamins I've been drinking this tea and I feel tons better. And I read some reviews about the taste - personally I love the taste! It tastes so good I want to start drinking it on a regular basis. It's a nice hot drink to have in the morning instead of coffee and it's tons better for you!<br /><br />I always make my tea with sugar and cream. I don't know how others make it - but adding sugar and cream makes it taste more like a drink than a tonic (which most teas taste like).	0	0

1	B001EPPGXG	A2Z52YNZ6TMFIL	Complex, strong and spicy	A little education in Ayurveda - In Ayurvedic principles, the Kapha 'element' is said to be similar to clay (elements of water and earth). It helps to hold our constitution together and provides structure, fluid balance, endurance and strength. It is the slow, stable, calming, sweet and cold aspect of the self and governs our resistance to disease and promotes self healing.<br /><br />An imbalance in kapha leads to respiratory illnesses, excess cough/cold symptoms, weight gain, general feeling of laziness/heaviness.<br /><br />Kapha tea is an excellent antidote to a kapha imbalance - the tea itself is spicy and invigorating with strong notes of cardamom, ginger followed by cinnamon and lemon verbena.  It's spicy, complex and my new favorite!  I ordered a bodum tea press so I can brew this tea at work.	16	0
1	B001EO69NS	A3475YO8NTGM3A	Best yogurt ever	Yogurt made with this starter and organic whole milk is simply the best I have ever tasted. It does not have the thin, sour taste that most of the single-culture starters produce. The taste is instead smooth and full-bodied. It is also thicker than most when a little dry milk is added. The process takes a bit longer, since the milk must be heated to 180 degrees, then cooled to 75. The cooling requires an ice-water bath, or the temperature would never get that low in our kitchen. After 12 hours in the Yogourmet Multi, which starts at room temperature and very gradually increases to 112 degrees, the yogurt is perfect every time. It is so good that it makes a good dessert all by itself, and is even better mixed with fruit. Combined with mayonnaise, it makes a fine potato or carrot-raisin salad. Smoothies are really smooth. Give it a try in your favorite recipe. You will love it!	44	1

They do a great job with packaging and shipping!  Most of my orders have shipped the same day I ordered.<br /><br />I have tried most of their coffees and have yet to be disappointed.  If you are looking for a good mid priced coffee I would recommend La Minita Tarrazu de Costa Rica.<br /><br />I highly recommend you check out U-Roast-Em for all your coffee needs!	3	1
1	B000CONMBS	A3LC9V7792TW52	The Best	I can't have popcorn kernels.  Other products I have tried are oily or contain trans-fats.  This product is the best tasting.  Not oily, just flavor.  And no trans-fats.  I highly recommend it.  This makes living without popcorn easy.	0	0
1	B000PDY3P0	A3T2XLNC5PP9EG	Awesome popcorn	I have a small theater style popcorn maker in my home-theater room. This popcorn is well measured and tastes great. All that being said, I am guessing it is not very healthy. We do not live on this product. What could taste so good and be healthy anyway. My only complaint is that the popping is so rigorous that I do get quite a few unpopped kernals that fly from the kettle. But with the old-maid holes in the floor, its a small price to pay for such a great product.	0	0
1	B002QWP89S	ARWGHMIEH0IRP	My puppies love them and it helps keep their teeth clean!	Got these large Greenies originally when we noticed our 60+lb Boxer mix puppies' teeth were getting a little dirty and brushing didn't too much.  We give them each one Greenie in the morning when we leave for work, they love them.  The boy gobbles it down, but his sister savors every bit.  They also keep the buildup on their teeth down quite a bit, they're not going to make them shine, but they'll keep them pretty clean!	0	0
1	B002QWP89S	A1PYC89LDBZ2J2	Greenies are the bomb!	We NEVER run out of Greenies! My little baby loves these treats. It is an added bonus that they are good for dental care as well.  Greenies got a bad rap for a while but they have been reformulated and are chewier now. We buy the teenie size for her because she is only ten pounds. My Mia dances for these treats and leads (herds) us to the treat jar for her daily fix!  Amazon has the best price for this quantity and shipping was fast!	0	0

1	B004R8J8E0	AHQ13I9CI4US6	Simplifying Dinner Prep with Shake 'n Bake	I've been using Shake 'n Bake for pork for more years than I'd like to remember. The compliments I've gotten are usually in regard to how tender the chops come out (I use boneless chops). One guest told me he'd never had pork chops this tender.<br /><br />If I am going to oven-bake pork chops, this is the only way I'll make them. I like the flavor of the mix, and it has a good texture. Preparation is super simple, and the chops cook quickly, so it's ideal for last minute prep--get the chops in the oven, and while they're cooking, make a  salad and whatever vegetable you're in the mood for. It sure beats frying.	0	0
1	B009GUDRDM	ACO3XSQ9JXOC2	Highly Recommended	This sugar alternative tastes like a mild sugar, but I really bought it for its low glycemic action. And I have to say it really does give me less of a sugar spike as compared to white sugar.<br /><br />I like the taste, very natural and earthy. It's not exactly like sugar, but very close.<br /><br />I think it tastes less sweet than sugar, but it definitely works just like sugar, with a ratio of  1 to 1 in recipes, as promised.<br /><br />Works perfectly in my cooking and in my tea!<br /><br />Highly recommended!	1	0
1	B002UNFJI8	A3EOKN5N64B7W5	excellent product	Really easy to buy from seller and the product is great! Will continue to buy from the seller. The beans are great tasting and really easy to open the little bags and to carry around.	0	0
-1	B001LG945O	AL4SB31UAZLXL	I recommend other flavors instead	I wrote a 5 star review of the Kiwi Berry flavor.  That isn't usually my favorite flavor of anything, but it was surprisingly good.<br /><br />Orange Tangerine (which would generally be among my first picks of fruit-flavored beverages is flat by comparison -- literally.<br /><br />It seemed to lack the right amount of carbonation.  It also tastes weaker and too sweet.<br /><br />Try the Kiwi Berry instead.	0	1
-1	B0013NUGDE	A23W3FV2HT3ZZL	Edible	I bought these on special when they were only about $13 for 24 .8 oz bags.  It's an absolutely wonderful deal.  But unfortunately I don't like them... at all!  I've tried Salt & Pepper, Original, BBQ, Salt & Vinegar; but these are just awful!  I've loved all the other flavors and I like Sour Cream & Onion chips normally, so I'm not sure why I dislike these so much.  I'm hoping I can somehow return them.	0	1

1	B001E95KQK	A11T0V94J1YJTO	Great organic coffee at an affordable price	As a stay-at-home mom of 3, two under the age of 4, I love coffee.  And as much as I drink, I prefer the organic coffee.  I was skeptical about this brand, hadn't seen it in stores, but I love it.  I do the subscribe and save option so it is even more of a great deal.  The price is what drew me in at first and I have not been disappointed.  Great coffee	1	1

-1	B000KV61FC	A2DNCSRWGV1QE1	Great while it lasted	My one year old Lab. loved the bottle filled with his kibble. The kibble fell out when tossed around. He carried the bottle into the kitchen started tossing it and it cracked when it hit the tile floor at the screw end  ALL kibble fell out and it broke into sharp pieces and it was a scramble to get the piece before he tried to eat and swallow them.  You know Labs they will eat anything halfway looking like food.  The bottle is not very durable on hard surfaces.  The same would have happened on the patio deck I am sure.  Expensive for the 30 minutes he used it.	1	0

1	B000GG5IZA	A2VMB1J58SUVMC	Hope this is helpful	I use this as iced tea and have been using large amounts of this product for some time.  It is $3.39/box localy.  I use a box every 4 days.  It adds up to allot of money.  Buying this on subscription, I am paying about $2.50/box (no shipping fee for Prime members).  That is a substantial difference in price.<br />Next....  This is a delightful iced tea.  To make 1 gallon I steep 10 bags in a about 2 cups water, and then steep them a second time.  Wring them out and add all to pitcher.  I then add 40 tabs equal and 2 individual packets lemonade (the kind intended for bottled water) and get a wonderful beverage that everyone loves.  Enjoy!!!!	0	0

1	B0009F3SAK	A354ZHJDR7XSWO	Effective and easy to drink	I was pleasantly surprised by this tea... I'm in good health generally and I don't take any medications.  I ordered this because the other reviews intrigued me, and I knew I wanted to gently support my liver & kidneys.  I'm not an expert on elimination or anything, but I feel like this makes those processes more effective.  Since last summer I've been on a mission to lose about 25 pounds, so I changed my diet and exercise habits, and lost 20 lbs by November; that seemed to be my limit and I was OK with it.  I started drinking this tea right after Christmas and after 2 weeks, I lost 3 lbs!  I know I probably shouldn't attribute this to the tea but it's the only change that I made to my routine... I wouldn't recommend this to anyone as a weight loss product but I mention it because it was an unexpected side benefit to me.  I think it does just make it so my body can get rid of waste more completely, on a consistent basis.<br /><br />It tastes good to me, earthy and mild... I like that it doesn't have as strong a licorice flavor like a lot of the Yogi Teas seem to, though it does contain licorice root.  I drink it plain, hot and strong, usually 2 teabags in a 20-oz mug or 1 bag in a smaller mug.  I like to drink it in the morning, and again in the late afternoon when I'm at work.  Since it doesn't contain tea, I like steeping it for even longer than 5 minutes to get the most out of it.  I usually take green tea in the morning, so I've been combining that with the Detox Tea but am going to try the Skin Detox Tea instead, to make it easier.  Also I feel the green tea detracts from the flavor of the Detox Tea somewhat although I still find it perfectly palatable.  Hope this helps!	9	0

1	B001HTI5I2	A10B89QOKDV5O3	Organic, simple, and fast!	My husband refuses to eat fish, but he LOVES this. It only takes 10-12 minutes to make, and is way better than any other kind of Tuna Helper I've tried.<br /><br />Besides the box itself, you'll need:<br /><br /> - 1 can of tuna (6 oz., or I use 8 oz.)<br /> - 1 tablespoon of butter<br /> - 1 cup of milk<br /><br />It's a breeze to prepare, just DON'T leave it alone before you put the tuna and pasta in. Because of the milk, it likes to boil over. Just keep an eye on it and reduce the heat right after it starts boiling.	0	0

1	B000PDY3P0	A1U0JTRGGRVYQJ	Amazing Cinema-quality Popcorn!	I'm kind of a popcorn fiend (I routinely walk into theaters just to buy popcorn and walk out without bothering to see a movie), but I hate-hate-HATE microwavable popcorn.  My wife bought me the Great Northern Little Bambino tabletop popcorn machine for Christmas, and I ordered the 24-pack of Great Northern popcorn packs because they were compatible with the machine and had consistently good reviews.<br /><br />We decided to take the popcorn machine for a test run during our NYE party, and the popcorn was, without a doubt, some of the best I've ever had.  It was just the right combination of salty, buttery and fresh, and it was a cinch to make.  Everyone at the party loved the stuff (we went through half the box), and I find myself craving some now as I write this review...<br /><br />In short, I enthusiastically and wholeheartedly recommend this popcorn.	0	0
1	B000G7VYWU	APP8XWYYV4PAA	Too healthy for most people in my office	Great buy but it seems that they are not very popular in my office (less healthy chip snacks are more popular) Still a great product, fresh and tastes like a pretzel should without any additives.	0	1

1	B001BDDTB2	A16AXQ11SZA8SQ	My cats love this stuff!	I wasn't quite sure my cats would eat this because I've never fed them anything other than dry kibble.  I needn't have worried; my cats love it!<br /><br />I like that it has human grade ingredients (no bad odors here) and that it contains absolutely no gluten (the ingredient that caused a massive pet food recall a few years back).  Something I didn't know before ordering Petite Cuisine is that it comes in recyclable aluminum cans, which means it won't contribute to the overflowing landfill problem.<br /><br />All in all, my only complaint is the cost, but I will probably buy more for my cats as a special treat.  They will love me for it.	0	0

-1	B0036FOV2O	A2ZKLDWOZ2TNZG	Don't waste your money	These reviews are all from sometime ago, and perhaps what was said was true at that time. But let me warn anyone looking for some good Rwandan coffee right now, do not waste your money. I have tasted true good Rwandan coffee, which is very similar to Kenyan coffee. Most African coffees taste naturally citrus sweet. I don't know what was in the bag I got. The aroma was terrible (like the beans had partially absorbed some odd flavor from something else) and it tasted just the same. I had to toss the 3 pound bag.	3	0
1	B005K4Q1VI	A2C494FJ3TX9DI	Great!	I love these! The price is VERY good...all the flavors are really good! The peppermint one is my favorite and I would gladly take more of that before the others.

1	B000YSS7EO	A1EALBNCP76T63	Love at first bite	Our 6 month old loves this product. My only issue, is that our daughter has struggled with constipation, even with breast milk. The brown rice causes more of this issue. Our doctor recommended we use oatmeal instead, wish I would have bought the case of oatmeal instead. So if your child has these issues, I would recommend ordering the oatmeal. We have been missing a little bit of pureed prune to overcome the constipation and it works like a charm! We will now buy one can of the oatmeal to try and if she likes it, will order another case!	1	0
1	B001EQ53K6	A3DOPYDOS49I3T	Really good!	These are really good and very convenient. This is probably my favorite flavor. Not too sweet and doesn't have aftertaste. These packets are really convenient. I carry them everywhere. On my pocket, backpack and car. I try to have them everywhere I can to prevent drinking soda. So far so good. These were recommended from my nutritionist. I had a bad soda habit. I would drink way too much soda in one day. She recommended to drink lots of water but if I had an urge to drink something sweet then to drink a crystal light drink. I haven't had a soda for a few months now. Now I drink lots of water and have about one to two of these packets everyday.	0	0

-1	B0021L8XTG	A6YKLUPM4VICA	Gross	These bones are just gross.  First of all, they are not wrapped tight enough to keep them fresh.  When you open them up, they just smell old.  They are dry and brittle and break just by touching them.  I gave one to my 2 year old lab and within seconds it was splintering.  I threw the entire pack away, along with the pack of smokehouse knuckles I bought at the same time.  GROSS. I would not recommend these.  Ask the meat man has way better quality products. Real bones for Real dogs, not this fake crap.  Don't buy!	2	1

-1	B004LL7GHO	A2QW3U7T82OI4P	Taste: definitely a matter of personal preference	I am constantly trying new foods, and when I read about the nutritious value of almondmilk, I decided to get a two-pack. About two weeks later, I opened my first one and gagged when I added it to my cereal. The taste was just unbearable, and for once, I found my vocabulary lacking in adjectives to describe it's taste. I checked the expiration date, which wasn't for another 8 months, and left it onto my refrigerator. Perhaps I purchased a bad batch, because the other one started bloating just sitting on my counter (I purchased the shelf-life ones and refrigerated them after opening).<br /><br />The only way I can tolerate the taste is to put some protein powder in it and mix it with some agave syrup. I've eaten a lot of MRE's in my time in the Army, and this easily ranks below any nasty thing I've eaten (or drank). I'll stick with my regular 2% milk and continue with a vitamin supplement for nutrition.	0	3

1	B000G1X456	A1HX18FYPSN0AM	Best Dark Roast coffee you'll ever drink!	Living in Baton Rouge my wife and I drank the popular regional coffee - Community Coffee, we now guess out of loyalty. When we became full time RV'ers in February 2007, we packed 5 lbs of that coffee but ran out in Missouri, so we tried other dark roast, including Maxwell House Gourmet Dark Roast and then the Yuban Dark Roast. OMG - what a difference!<br /><br />We'll never buy anything except Yuban Dark Road - smooth and silky without that burnt or bitter taste.<br /><br />Difficult to find in South Louisiana, but easier nationwide.

We use to buy them from our vet until they didn't have the large size one month and I check Amazon and I've been ordering them from Amazon ever since (cheaper too).  The vet had been after me to have the dogs teeth cleaned but now marvels at how clean my 10 year old Fox Terrier's teeth have become... and our two year old golden retriever's are the same.

1	B003KV7V1C	A1R01R1QNFKYL3	Fantastic, and well worth the price	"I bought this jerky for my husband because he loves jerky and spicy food (this one seemed like a no-brainer based on the reviews). To be honest, he was thrown off by the very bright red color when he originally got it and let the jerky sit for a few days while he worked up the courage to try it (bright red, chipotle, habanero, it was a little intimidating). Once he tried it, he fell in love. It's soft, tender, flavorful, not too salty, in essence, in his words, it's like ""spicy carne asada, and not the junk, tough carne asada you get at the tex-mex places"". It's all he can do to only eat one piece, he loves it!  Well worth the price."	0	0

-1	B001AW9PTO	A30LKCYYLLDKFT	Way Too Salty	I read the reviews and thought, I like salt. I thought the saltiness was on the exterior of the jerky.  There is very little salt taste on the outside of the jerky but the saltiness comes out with every chew. The strips are about the size of a chopstick or a very thin pencil. 12 ounces for $20+ is way too expensive.  There is very little beef flavor but too be fair it is probably covered up by the salt.  These taste very similar to the chopped and formed cheap jerky at the convenience mart that you swear you will never buy again but much more salty. The amount of salt made my tongue numb, if you want good jerky keep looking. (Jack Link's Smokehouse Beef jerky strips, wood smoked 30-count jar)	0	1

Eventually he began throwing up blood and was passing it from his bottom. We thought he was going to die, these symptoms all happened over a few days time.<br />We took him to the vet, they ran tons of tests found nothing wrong and gave him a hydration IV and sent him home with instructions for a diet of puree chicken and rice. Days later we gave him a little bit of the dry cat food with his special food. Hours later he was terribly sick again. It was then that we realized the food made him this deathly ill!<br />DO NOT BUY GOODLIFE it almost killed our cat!	2	4

1	B000BTK12M	A3PI8JJ2E4VT5E	Excellent quality	I asked my brother, who is a chef, how he felt about the quality of the product he received and if he could recommend it to anyone. His comments were that quality was excellent and he would enjoy having it again in the future as a gift. He looked at the idea of buying something similar from Hickory Farm in the Mall where he lives since Mother's Day caught him and me by surprise since it arrived a week early this year and he came to the conclusion that this product was far better product than anything he could find in the Mall. I had thought Hickory Farm would work since he would have physical access to viewing any items from them and his comment was that Wisconsinmade, this company whose product I am reviewing, did a far better job in quality and produce. I think that says it. For those who see only volume and not quality, stay with the grocery store, it will give you lots of volume if that is your criteria.  I will note that I bought a couple of these products from this company and I have copied the same review to each so that people will know that this company has excellent quality.  Quality cheese and quality sausage is expensive and this company makes it well.	6	1

1	B0013NUGDE	A2GPJR489OIH42	"So much better than ""baked"" chips"	About 3 months ago I stayed at a hotel in Los Angeles and these chips were in the room, offered comp to hotel guests. I am not sure I would've tried them otherwise, but I am glad I did and now I'm addicted. I am a thin person so it's all about the taste for me, calories are not an issue. I've never really liked the taste of greasy chips, but baked chips seemed so bland. These chips are the best  and you should give them a try. They are tasty and not greasy. My personal favorite is the original potato flavor, but they are all pretty good.<br /><br />Highly recommended. I don't normally review food products but these were so good I wanted to share.	2	0

1	B0013NUGDE	A2CXLQXPUJRRMX	Best BBQ chip on the market today, they POP with flavor!	I just love these chips! The BBQ are by far my Favorite. The BBQ flavor is a little sweet with a hint of smokiness, very addictive. They are light and as far as junk food goes they are healthy..'er than your regular chip. They do not leave your fingers greasy or any oily / greasy feel or taste in your mouth. That is because they are hot air popped and not fried. I almost ate the whole bag on my first taste; by the way it was the huge Costco size bag, twice the size of their large bags. With in two days I was back at Costco to by another bag.

1	B007M83302	A3W0GMJ0FYSW3J	Awesome healthIER snack option!	I first had Popchips last week at a local deli in Miami. I was so impressed with them that I came online to find them (not even remembering the brand name) and I'm so happy that my favorite online retailer Amazon offers them. I don't necessarily want $20 worth of chips (LOL) but on the other hand, I love them so much that I do need that many so I can have half at home, and half at work (in different flavors). And I'm sure this price is much cheaper than buying them one by one at the deli I go to.<br /><br />I am a serious chip lover but am always looking for healthier alternatives. I love that these chips are low in calorie/fat but taste 10X better than baked chips. There's something about a need for salt n crunch that baked chips don't solve for me. I've found most of them to be bland, flat, weird, cracker-like. As soon as you put one of these chips in your mouth you'll realize that they're not lightweights at all. I love the salt/vinegar and was very surprised that they don't lack flavor or taste less salty/vinegar(y) than their high calorie counterparts. The crunch of the chip reminds me of a ligther alternative to a kettle chip or the General Mills chips, Bugle. I am such a fan, and now that I've found these chips on Amazon, I don't plan to buy any other kind.	1	0

As a comparison, two tablespoons of ""regular"" store bought peanut butter is 5 points. The taste difference between this peanut butter and store bought peanut butter is so slight that it's not worth the extra calories to buy the ""ready to eat"" peanut butter.<br /><br />This product comes in a dry form.

1	B0005YYHQY	A2MWRKME57F53V	Superlative store bought cookies: very hard to find!	"Buy these cookies. You will not regret it.<br /><br />They are, hands down, the best store-bought chocolate cookies out there, and I buy every new brand that comes out (from Mrs Fields to all the permuatations offerred by Pepperidge Farms).<br /><br />These are much better than Entenmann's recent incarnation of ""new recipe"" chocolate chip cookies, the milk chocolate chip and ""soft baked"" chocolate chip cookies. Both of these newer cookie species are awful: the milk chocolate tastes like rotting bananas and the cookie part tastes like all the other crappy store-bought soft cookies out there.<br /><br />In contrast, Entenmann's Original Recipe chocolate cookie is a mind-blowing experience: delicious dark chocolate chips and a soft mouth-watering cookie with a unique but ineffable taste. They seem to have perfected the ratio of flour to sugar, so that the cookie is delicious without weighing you down with excessive sugary sweetness (this is again in contrast to their horrible new cookies).<br /><br />I have absolutely no idea why Entenmann's decided to nearly eliminate their sales of the classical recipe and replace it with these disgusting brands. It seems to have happened when the Entenmann name was bought by a larger multinational company, so it was probably a money-saving opportunity. The Original Recipe cookies likely have expensive ingredients.<br /><br />The only problem is they are so hard to find: thank goodness they are now on Amazon!!!"	7	1

Although grown from a tiny little seed that the sun and rain helps in growth it is our heavenly father our creator God who truly makes them grow and should be appreciated for his gift of life to us all and for our home the planet we call earth .<br />I used to be a true vegetarian then I went to only eating Poultry and some fish and eggs through out the years.Now I will eat vegetarian soup made with some beef stock but I don't care for the meat itself and no pork.<br />I am still Organic Alternative and Green but I am slowly trying to go back to being that true vegetarian that I used to be however going raw will take a some time because I have a little hard time chewing with my teeth like my friend but after I get my dentures I will be able to adjust into it .Right now I am canning for winter storage.I have dehydrated my whole garden into green super power food that I added to my barley greens. note if you choose to cook get the Fagor Pressure cooker caner That I got it helps make the meals go quicker and is a lot healthier than baking and Broiling or grilling and never fry food.<br />Well I will let you know how the canning turn out and one day I'd like to make home made all fruit yes that's right not jelly or jam.<br />Hi Again so far so good I have canned 4 pint jars of my home made spaghetti sauce with 4 of Chili and 4 vegetarian soups with 2 red cabbages and they sealed and are ready for winter when things get rough as around here it is hard to get organics so when I do I get all that I can like I just got up at the farmers market this late fall and then I either freeze them or can them and even dehydrate them.<br />So I will keep you up to date but I need to try and get some organic fruits and that is hard to get again around here.<br />well catch ya later as I never say goodbye!Just get this wonderful organic fruit nut and seed mix it has no preservatives and is delicious and affordable and if I can get it you can too. Just remember to soak the nuts and seeds because nature puts some  protective coating on it and they need to break down this to be edible and fit for human consumption.	0	0
1	B000S83LTQ	A1YUL9PCJR3JTY	Adult Adventurous Black Tea	*****<br />St. Dalfour's Organic Strawberry Tea is a black tea with some very slight strawberry overtones---not enough to make it berry-like, but enough to make it different. I found it excellent---I really liked it. I left the tea bag in as I drank the tea (the whole time, much longer than recommended), which turns most teas bitter, but not this one. So far, this has been my experience with all of the St. Dalfour's teas that I have tried, a big selling point for me since I enjoy my teas very strongly brewed.<br /><br />St. Dalfour is a French firm that makes natural teas, including this organic tea. There is not a lot of information about them on their web site beyond the basics, but what is there looks good.<br /><br />St. Dalfour's Organic Strawberry Tea is a nice variation on plain black tea. Note that black tea does contain caffeine.<br /><br />Definitely recommended.<br />*****	1	0

1	B007M83302	A2QB72NT6HE6WA	LOVE these chips!	I was lucky to have ordered chips on a Virgin America flight and was so excited to see them on Amazon!  They are light and crispy and they do not have MSG or anything bad in them.  They only have about 100 calories per bag and around 3 grams of fat.  I love them!  If you are a chip lover, try them!	0	0
1	B001AW9PTO	A15JEHADFOYKPS	Great flavor, wish it had a longer shelf life.	Great flavor, and texture.  It may not be the best jerky out there, but for the price, I couldn't find any better.  It comes in a few different flavors, so there's bound to be one you like.  I just wish the shelf life was longer, I'd love to keep this with the emergency food/water.	0	0
1	B000F2VESU	A28621TSIR5EOG	Thai Sticky Sweet RIce	I like fluffy rice but my boyfriend loves sticky rice. Could find stick rice in the local market, so ordered this rice. Sticky rice takes more time because you have to soak it. Came out great and now my boyfriend can stick his rice to his vegetables in big balls and is very happy.	0	0
1	B0009JHVN6	A19KMGRY2U1KKN	Absolutely Perfect - Just don't heat at too high a temperature	I bought Fireworks Wisconsin white birch popcorn 64oz seeking the perfect popcorn for my Whirleypop popper, but I wrecked the batches simply by cooking them too hot. Now I've discovered on my own how to do it RIGHT.<br /><br />  If you want perfect popcorn, here's my secret:<br />- Add 2-3 ounces of oil in popper + 3 kernels;<br />- On electric stove (yeah, I know) set burner between 8 and 9 on scale of 1 to 10. (If you set it for 10, you'll have small, lousy, and even unpopped results. Who knew!)<br />- When the 3 kernels pop, add 1/3 cup of kernels (any more than this and they'll spill over)<br />- Meanwhile, melt 1/4 to 1/3 of ONE cube of butter in microwave for 35 seconds.<br />- When popped, (turn the whirley handle to prevent popped corn from overheating / or shake your pot (the one on the stove) if you lack this popper) and pour into your favorite bowl, (don't put butter into your popcorn cooker) drizzling butter and sprinkling a smidgen of salt.<br /><br />  The very best you've ever had . . . true?<br /><br />Another Tip: I deliberately make extra, putting the rest into a FoodSaver airtight canister. It stays genuinely fresh throughout the week.<br /><br />  P.S. I'm just a happy customer. I don't sell popcorn. (But now I eat too much of it.)	8	0

1	B00068PCTU	A3B4KVOTQT9TII	Get Healthy Live Better and Longer	Cutting sugar out of our diet,we went to splenda. Then finding that it was also unhealthy and baking with it made foods flat and dry. We went to stevia no calorie powder, after much research proved that stevia has been used for hundreds of years with no bad health effects. The trick to using stevia is to use tiny amounts and then taste it and add a bit more at a time to suit your taste. I also found that using a stevia that has an 80% ratio is the best tasting and this is the best that I have found. Because of using VERY SMALL amounts this jar lasts for months. This is also the best price ANYWHERE! Swanson is a trusted vendor as is Amazon.	1	0

My CardioElectroPhysicist had never heard of no-salt ketchup, he thinks it's great!<br /><br />Heinz no-salt ketchup tastes wonderful!

1	B001EO7E0K	AQXJM6TILVEDY	Light scent and very pleasant	Another great Roland product!  I cannot say I've been let down by this brand.  Like the mussels, these, too, are packed in water and are already pre-cooked.  A little rinsing may be necessary, but there's no pungent or fishy odor; the water will run clear after light agitation in a strainer... or you can just pour into and dump out water from the can before using.  There's hardly any grit to be found in the clams themselves (as sometimes happens with the shelled critters like these, mussels, scallops, etc.).  Add them to whatever you want (I've stirred them in with a homemade marinara sauce and a few spices) or eat them separately.  My one concern was that they'd end up being rubbery, as clam bits tend to be, but these are very small, pretty much yanked whole out of the shell, and quite tender yet firm.  I'm thinking that perhaps they get rubbery if overcooked, but I haven't had that experience yet.  Highly recommended.	0	1

1	B000PDY3P0	AUWLJOZ214L2C	Great Popcorn	Great product, its really more popcorn than the 4 oz kettle can handle at one time, you have to experiment with it to figure out how much to use, I use about half of the corn for two popings and use very little salt.  The oil can be divided into two batches and it works out really great.  Makes a lot of popcorn, plenty for two or three people, and has a good taste, comes packed in a handy packets and just cut small corners out to pour the oil and popcorn into a measuring cup to put into the kettle.  Use the salt sparingly, there is way to much salt if you use it all.	2	0

I have a typical stressful position in a Fortune 500 company.  Since I have been drinking this, my overall stress level has reduced significantly.  It's not easy to succinctly describe.  But, this tea keeps away heartburn, and just enables one to feel a little more relaxed, especially when under stress.<br /><br />I drink it hot and cool.  You can also steep this more than once.  The most I will do is three times.  This is really good tasting tea.  I can drink it w/o sugar because it has a natural slight sweet/and tartness to it.	2	0

1	B007M83302	A3A1OA237FOZFK	From a picky eater - I love these	"I was a little hesitant to try these, especially after reading such mixed reviews although overall they were positive. However, I liked the idea that they are healthier than regular chips and I figured they would be great for school lunches, quick snacks, etc. I decided to give them a try and figured if we did not like them, they could be donated.  I ordered a mixed case the first time around to see which flavors we liked more (or less) and thought that would give us a good sampling.  After deciding we liked most of the flavors, we decided to try other ones as well.<br /><br />Despite the flavor preferences, these chips do not taste like cardboard.  At first taste, they are a little crunchier and thicker than you might expect. I think this is a good thing, because it means they are not heavily-laden with oil.  The 0.8 oz bags are 100 calories each as well, which is much better than the other alternatives and gives you the enjoyment of chips without the extra calories, trans fat, etc.<br /><br />I have included a summary of opinions below from myself, friends and family for each flavor:<br /><br />Sea Salt & Vinegar - Great, the absolute favorite flavor for everyone<br />BBQ - Very good, I'm not crazy about BBQ to begin with but would say this flavor is ""sweet"" BBQ. Everyone else loved them.<br />Cheddar - Very Good, probably close in preference to the BBQ<br />Original Potato - Good, but a little salty (seems to fluctuate somewhat between bags)<br />Salt & Pepper - Good, everyone liked them but preferred other flavors more<br />Parmesan Garlic - Good, but overall was 50/50. You definitely taste more parmesan than garlic and most people were expecting the latter.<br />Sour Cream & Onion - Not so good, no one really liked these enough to want more or to even finish the bag<br /><br />I know taste is a very subjective thing, but I hope this review helps someone decide to give these a try. I did get them at a reduced price through subscribe & save, and shortly after my first order, Amazon had them on the Gold Box for an even better price.  I think the average price per bag came out to approximately forty six cents a bag and had free shipping under my prime account."	0	0
1	B000EPR1J4	A2FAWO0517YUWE	We LOVE these crackers!	"These are the greatest crackers, either alone, or with a slice of cheese, or with a dip.  There's just enough wasabi to spice up what could otherwise be a dull-tasting rice cracker.  Yes, we like some of the other Ka-Me flavors OK, especially the black sesame <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YHMWS2"">Ka-me Rice Crunch Cracker Black Sesame And Soy Sauce, 3.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a> and the seaweed <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EPMP36"">Ka-Me Rice Crunch, Seaweed, 3.5-Ounce Units (Pack of 12)</a>.  But these wasabi ones are our favorites!<br /><br />We can buy these in the New York area;  in Michigan, we can get some other Ka-Me flavors but not wasabi;  and in Southern California we can't find Ka-Me crackers at all!  Go figger.  So it's great to have Amazon supply our ""cracker fix"" when we travel to the many places where these crackers seem to be extinct.<br /><br />By the way, they are also gluten-free, if you care about that.  Some folks think avoiding gluten, even if you're not actually allergic to it, can help weight control.  I look at it a different way - these crackers are only 7 calories each, and satisfying far beyond their calories - so they're sort of a diet food."	0	0

1	B000G6STC4	AUSE62ROJBKXO	LOVE THIS HOT SAUCE	I purchased this Hot Sauce while on a trip to South Dakota.<br />Since finishing it I have not been able to find it in any store on the East Coat.<br />I was so excited to find this listed on Amazon.<br /><br />I like HOT things. Although I won't do Ghost Chili Hot.<br />I really enjoy it because it is hot enough for me but not too much.<br />It has great taste as well. Not too vinegary as some other hot sauces are.<br /><br />For the size of the bottle, this is a pretty decent price too.<br />Was received in a timely manner too.<br />Will be re-purchasing when this bottle runs out.	0	0
1	B000633WEW	AYVG53NPDAIHU	Great food for senior dogs	"My dog is 12 years old, and his breed (powderpuff chinese crested) is very subject to gum disease and tooth loss. After the last visit to the vet, with surgery that cost 13 of his teeth, I have struggled to find him a food that he could eat, that he liked, and would maintain his weight, his energy level (very playful pooch!), AND be good for him. He doesn't like soft food, so it's been a real task.<br /><br />This food does it. It's not brittle or ""dusty"". It is shaped like pellets (almost like rabbit food) and breaks really easy. It's tasty, cause he scarfs it right up, and he also has managed to get some weight on him. He looks better than ever before. I can at last rest easy knowing he is getting a decent nutritious food."	0	0

1	B000CMIYWC	A1P9UMP1XSE6MI	Tea the way tea should be!	My husband recently stopped smoking (yay!) and this tea has really helped him clear all that junk out of his chest.  It has a pleasant taste and aroma, being neither too strong or too weak, and we both find ourselves drinking it simply for the flavor. This tea is great to drink during and after having any type of chest cold.  Good way to get fluids and soothe a cough related to illness.<br /><br />Yogi Tea products are the very best out there and buying them here at Amazon is way cheaper than buying them in a store ($4-$6 per box.)  We subscribed to a couple flavors so they arrive without having to specifically order them.  I love this feature!  Thanks Amazon!	4	0
1	B004D667DQ	A1R774PEJBWZAM	Great taste!	I was able to try these chips from a food show sample, and I fell in love.  They taste great!  Plus they are much healthier than the average chip.  Definitely recommend this product.  Let's get these in stores!	1	1

1	B001LGGH40	A1LA4K5JF78BER	My Family Likes It.	I don't read every label on every drink or food I consume. I understand the switch philosophy and can appreciate the idea. I must say that if you are really health conscious and want to consume what's good for your body then you would stick with mostly filtered water and natural 100% juices that are fresh that day. With that being said I do know that everyone in my family liked the switch drink and this particular flavor (kiwi berry). I now see switch in supermarkets and have purchased a few  single cans at lunch on occasion. I don't see myself purchasing in bulk however, as they are kind of expensive.	1	0
1	B001EQ5F9K	A2HGLCUDJ0QZHM	Delicious cereal - wish they packaged it in larger boxes!	So I have to admit that I am a cinnamon NUT.  I just plain love the spice in so many recipes I could never count. When Quaker first put this out I was a few trepidations about it.  Having loved the original flavor of Life cereal since as far back as I can remember I wasn't sure how they could add cinnamon to it and make it work - they did.  I'm one that loves to mix cereals and this one mixed with the Cinnamon Burst Cheerio's - love it so much I pretty much have this every day!<br />Get a box and try it!  If you enjoy cinnamon AND you enjoy original I think you'll enjoy this.  I do wish Amazon hadn't removed the 'Subscribe and Save' option - in all honesty, their full price for this is too much above what I can get it at the local discount store (I won't blame Amazon for not publishing this review!)	0	0
1	B004NC7IFQ	A2KF2I3XLRUEIV	Rishi Tea Loose Leaf Tea Bags	I like loose tea and hate having to clean out the metal holders.  These bags are ideal as they let me make a pot or just a cup of tea and then throw it in the compost pile to be reused for my garden.	0	0
1	B003XW70VY	A2QYQHZMAWD6I8	Great Tasting Tea, One Cup At A Time!	"I can't say enough about Keurig and their K-Cups.  I made the transition from a regular drip machine to the K-Cup machine two years ago, and I have never looked back.  I have recently expanded beyond just drinking coffee and the experience has been just as good.  These K-Cups taste just like making a cup of tea with the bag in the hot water.  The only real difference is that my tea is made a lot faster.  I use the different cup sizes to give the tea different strength levels based off my mood.<br /><br />Note: Sometimes, especially if you brew a lot of coffee, you may want to run the K-cup machine empty (without a K-Cup in it) since this will help flush out any leftover coffee grounds and/or ""flavor""."	0	0
1	B001AG9ZXG	A30Z63HV0NUD	Awesome!	My husband and I absolutely love this tea! It tastes great especially with a drop of honey and it is very relaxing. I have asthma and allergies and sinus problems ... and this tea sort of calms my whole respiratory system. So, I highly recommend this tea, I am sick right now, and I drank this tea with 2 tea bags and honey and I did feel better, a little easier time breathing. My husband uses it when he's stressed, and it does relax him and calm him. This tea is great througout the day and wonderful to relax with at night and really awesome if you are sick, to sit with and sip and just try and feel better.	2	0
1	B003120XGK	A2ROWEHCZANU07	Love this stuff!!	We use this in place of sugar for almost everything.  It has a light flavor, sort of similar to honey without the crystallization and the strong flavor.  The best part is the lack of sugar highs and crashes due to its lower glycemic index.	0	0
1	B0001E3LBU	A2Q1ZSJSLC7LK8	Great Jerky!	I prefer jerky with a dry texture but always have a hard time finding a good one.  They're usually moistened soft chunks of meat instead of hard strips.  If you like old-school jerky then I highly recommend this product.  Delicious!	2	0
1	B007M83302	ALL9XFM0Q1N4E	A Great Alternative to Regular Chips	Popchips are really a great snack and not just an alternative to regular chips but a full on replacement as far as I'm concerned. The taste and texture are great for the Jalapeno ones. I hate greasy fried chips and often switch the baked version of any chips. Now I have another choice...POPPED! If you like flavored chips and you want something crunchy with a great taste then you owe it to your self to try a bag of Potato Popchips!	0	0
1	B001P3NU30	A1TF4NE87O5TFR	CET Chews work, but lets be smart about this people...	"I have 2 Siberian Husky puppies, now 5 months old, each weigh about 40lbs and they both have been using the C.E.T. Enzymatic Oral Hygiene Chews for over 3 months.  I've consulted with my Vet, Animal Shelter, and Obedience Trainer who trained dogs in the military for 20 years; ALL agreed that this is a good and safe product BUT like anything else you give you puppy/dog SHOULD be supervised AND timed.  They also all agreed that the limit on giving these chews should be between 10-20 minutes and either taken away for future use, or the remainder thrown away.  If you are a SMART pet owner, you will be supervising the use of this product and if after 10 minutes, the product is beginning to be swallowed, I guess it makes sense to take the product away.  These work exactly for what they are intended, to reduce and remove tarter and plaque.  It is NOT a treat or toy!  As much as it CAN be digested, yes, some dogs will try to swallow too big a bite and begin to choke.  As pet owners, again, supervision is needed.  Remember, I have TWO pups, and after 15-20 minutes, all I need to say is ""drop it"" and they listen and do so because I am also a RESPONSIBLE pet owner and have already begun training them to listen.  If the chews aren't too badly mangled, I save for the next/another day, otherwise, they get trashed.  The only other note I will also agree on is the lack of consistency in size/shape of these chews.  Great product otherwise."	1	0
1	B000GG0BPW	A3FPD0KH64DG9Z	Best  tea ever	The french vanilla decaf tea is an excellent full body tea that makes two cups. I have been purchasing this tea from Bigalow for years and am now happy that i can purchase this through Amazon	0	0

1	B0047ORGWK	A2LPVWUBCX0U6O	Great for picky toddlers!!!	My little boy is nearly two and has become an extremely picky eater.  The peas and carrots he used to love just get thrown on the floor and the little chunks of squash I give him - he spits them out and makes himself gag!  So, these pouches are my salvation!  I mix the powder with a little milk into macaroni and cheese and voila!  Now he eats macaroni and squash and cheese or macaroni and peas and cheese and we are both happy :)  The squash is also great mixed into spaghetti sauce.  It's just an added bonus that they can sit in the pantry without going bad for weeks or months so I always have some veggies on hand for him.	0	0
1	B005HGOIQ4	A1W2K4IA2FRAG6	Best Sugar Substitute I Have Found	I use coconut sugar in everything that I used to make with cane sugar:  cookies, muffins, chocolate syrup, fruit crisps, cakes, etc.  A handful of helpful tips:  (1) It can be made into a fine powdery consistency by blending it in a Vitamix, food processor, or even a good coffee bean grinder.  (2) This enables one to make powdered sugar (just add 1 TB arrowroot powder or tapioca starch per 1 cup finely blended coconut sugar).  Then coconut sugar can be used to make icing and the like.  (3) Sweetened condensed milk can also be made. (See allrecipes.com's recipe for regular sweetened condensed milk.  Ingredients are: 1 1/8 powdered milk, 1/2 cup water, 3/4 cup coconut sugar, blended to a fine consistency.)  It isn't all that pretty (beige color) but it makes wonderful lemon bars.<br /><br />Coconut sugar doesn't taste exactly like cane sugar (more maple-y and hearty), but there is no sugar crash since it has a low glycemic index of 35 (lower than apples and carrots).  It is loaded with potassium, along with nitrogen, zinc, magnesium and several vitamin Bs (as opposed to agave syrup, which is fairly empty of any nutritional value).<br /><br />Additionally, this price that Amazon offers is less than my co-op's bulk price.	11	0
1	B004FK9HMS	A19J27JD7HVEOR	Awesome	These things are the best idea ever! Not only can I have a sugar free Cosmo, which I never could before, but now I can carry these little packets around with me and have one anywhere there is vodka and water. And they taste awesome!	1	0

I thought is was such  great idea to have multigrain cereal just like what I eat.<br />BIG MISTAKE.<br />This gave my baby the most horrible gas and it took me months to realize it was the cereal causing this. Only when my mother-in-law said ""Boy, if I eat whole grain cereal in the evening, i act like a trumpet all night"" did I think. ""Waou, maybe it's the cereal"".<br />I've stopped giving her this and no more crying, arching and farting!"	0	0
1	B0015DXT4K	A103FPM7ABVMAW	Cream of Tartar at a bargain price	I bought this for cooking; from whipping egg whites to making my own baking powder, this cream of tartar is great.  I put some in a small jar in my cupboard for everyday use, the remainder I keep sealed tightly in the freezer.  It will last quite a long time, and buying it this way is exponentially less expensive than buying the small, over-priced jars in the grocery market.	0	0
1	B0017I753O	A291HTT117RVS9	Nice, seriously chewy apple goodness	I really like these. They are sort of hard and take a while to really chew, but that makes them seem more substantial to me. Nothing bad in them (e.g. fat), and they have a great apple flavor - mellow rather than tart.	0	0
-1	B0018AGPKU	A4ZGPH50QWA1F	new and improved flavor is AWFUL!!	"UPDATE:  My original review is below this update. but if you are looking for the original Spear O Mint flavor (which is great), these are now the ""new and improved"" flavor which is terrible.  It is not just a slight difference, it is a complete overhaul.  It is more like Pep-O-Mint with an overpowering chemical flavor.  It seems someone at the company must have decided since some people like ""conspicuously strong mints"" we should sell them.  Unfortunately instead of leaving my favorite flavor Life Saver alone and coming out with a new strong mint, they made the foolish decision to re-flavor these.  I actually started choking on them it was so bad.  I thought it was just a mistake (I've had Pep-O-Mint occasionally mixed in a pack of Wint-O-Green or Spear-O-Mint before), but I quickly realized no, it is just the ""new and [not] improved"" flavor.  I've contacted the company previously (when they started adding artificial sweetener to some of the regular flavors) and they told me that their ""taste tests"" revealed that folks preferred the new flavor.  I think they must have found a test panel of folks who like the aftertaste of artificial sweetener.  I'm going to complain to the company again, but it will probably once again fall on deaf ears.<br /><br />MY ORIGINAL REVIEW [based on the original flavor Spear-O-Mint, which I also gave 5 stars]<br />These have become extremely hard to find.  It seems that the stores believe there is only a market for sugarless mints.  I hate sugarless products and the associated throat dryness that comes with consuming them.<br />These are great tasting, sweetened with sugar, and also seem to act as an upset stomach reliever."	0	0
1	B000FBM3YK	A2OWR2PL3DLWS4	Great- and good Sell By date	I'll start with something really important to me- the sell by date.  I bought these cookies in January of 2010, and they are good until 9-2010, which is important to me, since I hate eating rancid food, so I just throw it out.  I've always loved these cookies, and my market sells them for much more than the subscribe price, so I'm happy to subscribe and save.  I love currants, and it's hard to find things flavored with them.  I have to admit, the currant taste is not strong, but they are delicious anyway, and I love the puff pastry.  Further, I'm allergic to GMO corn starch (genetically modified corn starch)- and just try to find cookies in US stores without corn starch (and 95% of all corn is modified in the US, and does not have to be labeled so).  So these are a real treat for me- since they are a cookie I can actually eat.<br /><br />The cookies are flaky, as puff pastry always is, and slightly sweet.  As other people have said, this is not a terribly sweet cookie, but it is quite sweet enough.  I enjoy mine with tea, and I also take them in my lunch.  If you take them in your lunch, put them in a little box- because they ARE delicate, and you might end up with delicious crumbs if you don't protect them.  I know this because I squashed them once.	0	0
1	B000084EKW	A1L43KWWR05PCS	MMMMMMMEEEEEEEEEEOOOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWW...	These Fancy Feast Variety Packs, which contain twenty-four cans, always ensure that you have a good supply of cat food on hand. I also do not have to waste my time stacking individual cans.  I always have a box of this one, the Gourmet Variety Pack, which is fish and seafood based, on hand. It contains eight cans each of ground ocean whitefish and tuna, salmon and cod, as well as sole and shrimp.<br /><br />I also always have on hand the Fancy Feast Sliced Variety Pack, which contains eight cans each of beef, chicken hearts and livers, and turkey. In addition, I also have a box of the Fancy Feast Grilled Variety Pack on hand, at all times, which contains eight cans each of grilled beef, turkey, and chicken, each in their own savory sauce. My cat, Mamushka,  loves them all.	2	1
1	B0044A8ZW2	A1Y3QKMCHRT73Y	Best Gum Ever	Does what it claims to do. It helps clean your teeth while promoting fresh breath. The flavors are natural and delicious without being too sweet. They're crunchy on the outside, provided you don't get a stale pack, and then they become good and chewy. With two pieces, which is recommended, you can even blow a few small bubbles. This is the only gum we will chew ever since we discovered it at our local health food store and then, happily, started finding them for sale on Amazon.	0	0

1	B00061EOHI	A437V8QIIXBZJ	great popcorn	We like this popcorn for its taste and texture.  Although it is black, it pops up whiter than other popcorns, and is more crispy IMO.  We used to buy it in stores, traveling about 15 miles to the nearest one.  However, it costs much less at Amazon.com when you buy two cases - no shipping and no taxes. The bags are always consistent in popping quality: 2min., 10 sec. in a 1200 watt microwave. It is a good product for a small gift on birthdays, when visiting friends for dinner and at Christmas time.	2	0

The individual serving pouches are handy for snacks on the go, and assist in those moments when one might wish to overindulge in this decadent-tasting, yet extraordinarily healthful cereal.  Generously interspersed with the delicious oats are yummy toasted nuts and perfectly dried fruits.  The only regret I have about this product is when I'm down to my last packet, which is why I'll purchase it from Amazon by the case-full.  You'd better hurry and order yours, too, because I might just hoard it all for myself!	2	0

1	B000084ETV	A1H5YKEACG3Z1K	found the winner!	Ok i have been through several dog food brands (all high end holistic fancy stuff)and have been through some ruff (lol) times finding just what works perfect for my  female Rhodesian Ridgeback. Now i wont bash any brands as some seem to do because some food seems to work with one pup and not another so dont be a jerk and think some food is crap because it didn't work out for your dog, be a good owner and look for things they like and react well to :-)..... now that being said i had a neurotic on edge dog with huge shedding issues and RR's don't shed. This food was like the miracle cure and after a year of my poor little girl trying different foods all she gets is complements on how great she looks from strangers as we walk the streets. if your used to high end prices this food is also a value seeing that you get 44#'s which does make a difference trust me. so as for us its a full five star no shedding, great coat, healthy mind and a value! don't be afraid try this if others arnt working out for your dog or even if you want your puppy to look even better.	2	0
1	B000CMIYWM	AULIHX03CFCF8	searching for peace	My anger/tension/irritability is off the scale and I have been trying anything and everything to help myself calm down. I have been using the calming and bedtime teas for the past 2 weeks and I have to say that even though I still get quite mad, I do feel that I have been calmer and not as snappish as I was. The flavors are delicious, especially with honey. I also suffer from gastrointestinal issues and it hasn't really helped in that respect, though....but I'm on some Crohn's level issues. I must say that it has helped with the severe tension headaches that work and kid give me daily, especially when trying to go to sleep. It is nice to be able to use a natural product to help myself with my anger management problems instead of loading up on medications.	7	0

I do know that my dogs snapped these up and went to their perspective corners to enjoy these treats.  Going to your special place to enjoy a treat at my house only happens when the treats are tasty.

We do not like the dry and more on the salty taste of these chips.

1	B001BDDTB2	ASPOWEJIPMYYW	made my kitties into addicts	"We have three cats. The two older ones are huge, 10-year-old DSH males, litter mates, who have been separated about 5 days their entire lives and have had just about the best of everything all along. The third is a 5-year-old Siamese male who adopted us as a tiny kitten; he was malnourished and his physical condition showed it when he came to my back porch 4.5 years ago.<br /><br />All are at healthy weights and are active. The big cats are not obese - they're just large cats. I always have dry IAMS available as kibble 24/7, and I give them each a portion of canned food a couple of times a day; they do not ask for food unless they are hungry. The older cats don't like poultry or beef (read: loudly whine for seafood when presented with chicken, in stunned disbelief that I'm not running a restaurant after the 5,391 times they've already complained). The Siamese isn't as picky because he was a stray until he found us. Mushy, gooey loaf? Won't eat it at all. Texture is important.<br /><br />I had not heard of this brand before I saw it here on Amazon.com and I have not seen it locally. Since my little monsters enjoy food, like this <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010B6IFY"">Fancy Feast Gourmet Cat Food Grilled 3-Flavor Variety Pack, 3-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>,  I thought I'd try the 'Subscribe & Save' option for a couple of months to see if they like Petite Cuisine too.<br /><br />Verdict: they're absolutely nuts about it. We call it 'kitty crack' - if there was a rehab or 12-step program for addicted cats, I'd have to send all three of mine for treatment. They can't get enough of it.<br /><br />This is definitely not fish 'flavored' food. The cans are chock full of fish, with tiny shrimp, flaky red snapper, tuna, and whitefish. It smells like fish but it doesn't have a fishy or stale odor. The cans open easily and not much sticks to the bottom and sides of the can - I can just dump food into a bowl without using a utensil to get the last bits out. The aroma and appearance are so good that _I'd_ eat it if I had to do so.<br /><br />I have read and noted concerns about menadione. However, high doses mentioned in some studies aren't equivalent to the small amount contained per portion in this food. To me, the benefits outweigh the risks. Best of all, my Siamese has developed a shiny, thick, ultra-soft coat which he did not have before he started eating this food. He's almost as soft as a chinchilla.<br /><br />In short: looks great, smells great, and I have happy, happy cats. A winner. :-)"	3	0
1	B0055TCURC	AWMY8C81OEABU	healthy, but taste good!	I love Larabars.  They are the simplest ingredients, but don't taste processed.  I ate them during my pregnancy as a snack when i didn't feel like preparing something, but wanted something relatively healthy and quick to satisfy my hunger.  And the peanut butter & jelly is my favorite because it has a nice combination of peanut with the cherry fruit.  (unlike say cherry pie or peanut butter cookie, it has it all).	0	0
-1	B0062A87HA	A5EK01Z5TAWOT	BIG mistake	i just received  my cans and should have listened to the reviews. i tried to be positive and go with the reviews who received the cans in perfect shape. what a mistake. ALL but 2 cans were severely dented. the other 2 still had dents. i don't think i could open them if i tried, but i would be afraid to eat the product anyway. i will not pay to send them back. they were wrapped well in bubble wrap so they weren't damaged in transit. they were sent out with the sender KNOWINGLY sending imperfect cans. they should be ashamed of themselves, and if they want them back they should pay for the shipping!  i WILL not be taken in again. i want my money back. this is the FIRST item from amazon i have not been happy with.	13	3
1	B000F9Z1WI	A3R9Q9WQ1M1NYZ	Great 100 Calorie Treat!!	I loved the original Oreo Cakesters when they first debuted. But, I shied away from eating them on a regular basis because of the high calorie and fat content in each serving. So, when I saw the commercial for the 100 calorie version, I could hardly wait to try them, and I must say I am very impressed!<br /><br />While some of the 100 calorie snack cakes can have a dry, mealy consistency, these cakes are moist, decadent and taste 100% like the originals.....just smaller. I would recommend them to anyone who liked the original version, but is watching calories. Good job Nabisco!	0	0

-1	B000FDKQCO	A3IUI5L21CP1LM	oily, gritty finished product	i'm a big fan of hodgson mill products (we love their bread mixes, i use their pancake mixes.) i'm not afraid of whole grains  (i mill my own grains, wheat, kamut, rye, barley) and i even put milled flax seed in my (home made) yogurt. I've been a baker for 35 years and love to try new recipes.<br /><br />i had high expectations for this product but was very disappointed by the results: the box calls for too much fat and the baked brownies have a distinctly oily feel in the mouth.  I can enjoy the grittiness and the chocolate flavor is fine but i would caution buyers against the results if following the instructions on the box<br /><br />one of the problems is that the coarse texture of the mix does not allow the fat to be absorbed well.<br /><br />i will go back to making whole wheat brownies from scratch.  a little bit of time required... a little less convenient but brownies being a treat (and comfort food), the texture should be right :)	1	0
1	B002QWP89S	A3BYTYZ0PQGG8	buy in bulk!	My dogs love these greenies. Their teeth are super white from chewing on them and their breath somehow is no longer as stinky. The only thing is that they are a tad-overpriced, so I recommend buying them in bulk if you are truly satisfied with this product like I am.	0	0
1	B003H26J5I	A37XG57IZUM9XO	Im impressed!	I tried both these and just the plain shirataki noodles with zero calories purchased at my local Asian market and I prefer these the best. The plain Shirataki feel like a noodle shaped gummie candy when you eat them...not as hard but too 'slippery'..The House Brand with tofu didn't have that same 'slippery' taste. I didnt find preperation to be that bothersome as a couple of posters have mentioned. I just open them and pour them in a strainer and let the water run over them throughly, flipping them once or twice to get them rinsed well then I toss them in a pan of boiling water for about 15 seconds (they're already cooked) drain and season them however I wish. They have been a great addition to my low calorie diet. I just tried them last night with a packet of seasoning from a box of Suddenly Salad (classic) and I was in heaven...40 calories for the WHOLE bag!	15	0
1	B005YVW0JE	ADJDGIRNBYSDZ	Delicious Jerky!	If you have been disappointed by the jerky sold in the stores, order this stuff instead. The Sweet Chipolte jerky is very flavorful, yet the meat was soft and tender, and easy to pull apart. While a little more expensive, you can taste the difference. Trust me, you will Krave more of this jerky.	1	0
-1	B00139TT72	AMNLTAHWQWPVW	Deceitful brand name	"If you are looking for an actual organic dog food, Newman's Own is not the way to go. I accidently purchased this thinking it was what it claimed on the front package, only to read the ingredient list to find out that basically everything else but the chicken was organic. With all of the drugs and hormones fed to conventionally raised ""food animals"" this ingredient is the most important one that should be organic."	6	5
-1	B0006JKCZ8	A1P1GN9QHIXQG8	Inaccurate Product Description!!!	I ordered this product thinking it was going to come in a box of 24 (as it is described in the product description). I was a little unsure of whether or not this could be too good to be true, but when I saw that the weight of the item was marked as 6.1 lbs and the shipping/handling was $8 I felt pretty confident that I would be receiving the 24 count box that I thought this to be. When I received the package there was only ONE bone in it. So pretty much I spent $10 on ONE bone that I could have gotten at the store for $3. Dont make the same mistake as me! VERY poor product description by Ozbo!	1	0
-1	B001DST6IK	A1A4HUN306FZTA	Good for display, not so much for it's intended use	"First off, I hate to trash a product that is not only ""green"", but made in America, however we are less than pleased with this cutting board. First off the color of the one we received is way lighter than the one illustrated. I specifically want a color close to that shown to match our new kitchen cabinets. Right away upon using it AS a cutting board, small chips started coming off of the cutting surface and with just over a month of use, the board is now warped from being rinsed off under warm tap water so that it wobbles from side to side, definitely not what you want to happen when you are trying to cut something. Lastly, be aware that these boards are made of multiple pieces of wood glued together, ours is 4 pieces. I doubt this board will last half as long as the bamboo board it replaced."	3	1
-1	B000KFXEYE	A253XKAR4A93Z9	Not a gourmet product	I bought a case of this stuff (Dark Chocolate) based on the positive reviews. Big mistake. This is half a step above Swiss Miss. It is definitely not up to the level of Archer (Target brand), Twinings (some grocery stores), or Cadbury (overseas or very few grocery stores).<br /><br />Cocoa is the 4th ingredient. No chocolate as an ingredient. Bunch of fats and fillers. Archer has cocoa as the second ingredient and chocolate as the 4th and 5th ingredient. That's more like it.<br /><br />Stephen's chocolate has bad/very light color, little aroma, thin, doesn't dissolve. A very disappointing purchase.	1	2
1	B007G93D2U	AO5CXTQEUO89P	Strawberry Delight	This is a nice tasting white tea.  When brewing the Strawberry Paraiso make sure to steep for 2 minutes. You can boil the water in a teapot, but remember to add some ice cubes to cool it down in your tea maker.  The temperature is supposed to be at 175 degrees. It is my favorite so far from Teavana.

1	B0013NUGDE	A2PSC7LUNIDEAH	Somewhere between a rice cakea and potato chip.	If an old-fashioned potato chips and some rice cakes had a love child it would be this!  It has 100 calories per pag(3g of fat, 0g sat fat) and a sweet taste that reminds you of a rice cake that has a potato chip taste.  While it will not make you forget the classic potato chip, those who are looking for a salty 100 calorie snack will greatly appreciate this.	0	1

1	B005HGOIQ4	A1IU7S4HCK1XK0	Great in Thai recipes or curries, low glycemic though it is sucrose	Coconut palm sugar and date palm sugar are used in cooking in Southeast Asia. The sweetness is rather like a mild brown sugar or a raw sugar and coconut sugar is not highly processed, whereas cane and beet sugar are highly processed.<br /><br />Coconut sugar consists primarily of sucrose which is chemically the same as cane or beet sugar, but it has a small amount of glucose and fructose. Attention, diabetics, it should be dealt with carefully, though it is said to be lower glycemic, with a glycemic index of 35. It is said to be diabetic-friendly, but I'd be sure to test it out and measure blood sugar levels, to make sure how your system reacts to this sweetener. (I am not diabetic, but I am always chary of any new sweetener that claims to be low glycemic or better for diabetics as each person can have quite different reactions.)<br /><br />In any case, this has more minerals, less processing and tastes great. It's a really great substitute for raw sugar or evaporated cane juice and excellent especially for Asian cooking. I like jaggery sugar (date palm sugar) but as it comes in an unwieldy lump that needs grating, this granulated coconut sugar is a good substitute when making certain chutneys and other curries.	1	0

Definitely recommend this brand.	0	0
1	B006N3IG4K	A3R7R8ARVN2P3D	Outstanding, Bold, Lively Sumatran. best of the K-cups	"First you must know I am one who roasts my own green beans at home, including Sumatran, but also many African varieties. I like a STRONG cup of coffee. I use K-cups at work because we have no facility for rinsing/cleaning/getting water for a regular machine.<br /><br />Sumatran coffees generally have a very rich, earthy taste; some would describe it as being ""tangy"" almost. Having tried the two other main brands of Sumatran for K-cups, the Puck is by far the best. It is not as bold as something you would get from Starbucks or from roasting yourself, but it has all the flavor elements of a good Sumatran cup. It especially has that nice earthy taste. Even the aftertaste is rich.<br /><br />IMPORTANT: If you are looking for a k-cup that you will use on any other than the smallest cup setting, this coffee is not for you. In my opinion you get a Sumatran because you love strong coffee. Watered down it loses its distinctiveness. Get a generic french roast if you want weaker coffee with some flavor. I make mine with 2 k-cups, at the smallest setting. By camparison, I would give a Starbucks Sumatra mandheling a 10/10 rating for boldness. The Puck is about an 8, the Diedrich is a 4.<br />I highly recommend this coffee for bold coffee lovers, provided you use the smallest cup setting. You will not be disappointed. Best K-cup I have had yet, and I have tried many- Newman, Timothy's, Donut Shop, Diedrich, etc.<br /><br />Addendum: I have since tried th Green Mountain Sumatran, and gave that a one -star. Stale and bitter. I will definitely stay with Puck's."	12	1

I don't live close to Costco and now wish I bought more when I was up there. You have to try these chips they are so good. They are not too salty and they are very crispy. They are a little corny as well as a little grainy and naturally slightly sweet. Very best chips I've had, great with guacamole and hummus or just plain. They are worth my 3 hour drive to Costco!!!	9	0

The only sweetener is grape juice and apple juice concentrate.

The liquor is a light honey color, and the apricot overtones are pronounced on the palate.<br /><br />I would recommend this tea for anyone who enjoys green (or white)teas; wants to become more familiar with them, or as a gift for someone.	1	0

1	B00032IFCU	A3VLED8OXFVQ07	Simply the best	I love Drostes cocoa. We have many food allergies and cannot use the prepared baking chocolate, so I bake with cocoa. There is a huge difference between Drostes and the other brands. When I take baked items (usually brownies that are out of this world) to events, I label them to let others with food allergies what the ingredients are. Some people won't try them because there are no milk, no eggs, etc in my brownies. However, those who do try them keep coming back for more and say mine are the best. I have to agree, and I give the credit to Drostes.	3	2

1	B000634IC2	AHIK7BUXFRMT8	Our Beloved Cat Enjoys This Food and is Prospering!	We have used Purina Cat Food for our cats for decades with complete satisfaction. I'm truly amazed and puzzled by the bad results some of the other reviewers have been experiencing.<br /><br />We shifted to the indoor formula several months ago because we do not let our cat outside. We had been giving her the regular Cat Chow but she seemed disposed toward eating the living plants we had in the house so we hoped the indoor formula would help relieve this tendency on her part.<br /><br />Since we shifted over she has seemed to enjoy her food and has exhibited no adverse effects that we have observed; again I am really puzzled by the results some of the other reviewers have gotten. We still keep a little Cat Chow around and will give her some for variety's sake.<br /><br />To complete an earlier thought on eating plants, the indoor formula didn't seem to make a difference so we've moved the living plants outside.<br /><br />If anything changes I'll update this review and in the meantime I wish the best for the cats with the problems!	1	1

The flavor is very distinct and pleasant, as opposed to some Kuna and Blue Mountain blends we have tried before.	0	0
1	B002MXSAD2	A2GW7PIU744BC7	GREAT BABY FOOD STORAGE!!!	I was just making my 7 month old son some brocolli baby food when I realized I hadn't written a review for the Beaba Multiportion Freezer Tray.  I have two of them and I absolutely love them.  I make the baby food then freeze it.  If I have too much food and not enough tray space, I freeze some and then pop them out and put them in another tubberware container.  Whenever it is time for him to eat.  I pop one out, put it in the microwave for 30 seconds and we are good to go.  I even freeze my homemade rice cereal which makes it so much easier.  I would recommend this product because it is easy and cleans really well.	1	0

The only reason I stop ording is bacause I went to sugar free, and at that time he did not have it.  But for those of you that don't have to watch there fat in take, I would get this product from them.	0	0
1	B0013NUGDE	ASIMCC20UVK58	Great Chips Less Fat	"I eat chips almost every day and decided I wanted to find something that tastes as good but is lighter on unnecessary fat than regular types of chips. I bought a case of Popchips BBQ. These are satisfying and taste great. They don't taste exactly like any full fat chip products I've had mainly because they're not greasy at all, but they have a nice BBQ potato chip flavor. These are thick, crunchy, and light. I first bought the .8 oz bags and this serving size is on the small side for me with lunch (would probably be alright for a snack). 3 of the .8 oz bags works for me which of course bumps up the fat intake, but considering the same volume of ""regular"" chips has much more fat it is a significant fat decrease overall which is what I was looking for. I find the 3 ounce bags to be perfect. Even eating all 3 ounces works out to significantly less fat and calories than eating the same volume of other chips. This makes Popchips very satisfying to me, and I have bought many cases through Amazon.<br /><br />Heads up (mid-2011): Unfortunately the price has gone up significantly for these chips through Amazon, causing me to cancel my subscribe & save subscriptions. Popchips have popped up in local stores for significantly less per ounce. I love the convenience of the portioned bags and subscription but it's hard to justify paying double for the same product.<br /><br />The flavors are pretty straight forward but here's my thoughts...<br />Original flavor: Tastes like a plain potato chip minus the grease. Not my favorite flavor, but good for what it is. This flavor would probably be good with some kind of dip.<br />Chedder: Cheddar quickly became tied with BBQ for my favorite. Like BBQ the cheddar flavor is very strong. Great chips.<br />Salt & Pepper: Very strong pepper. To enjoy these you have to really like pepper. I like them, but they're not a favorite.<br />Sea Salt & Vinegar: I'm not a fan of vinegar, but strangely I enjoy this flavor. They're indeed salty with a fairly strong vinegar flavor."	1	0

The worst part is more than half the chocolate was melted out of the wrappers into the box and all over the remaining chocolate. I would only consider doing this again in the winter months.	0	0

And now when her friends come over, they leave telling their parents, ""I love carrot juice!""

1	B0048HWXA6	AHRORJOVVNLVO	A Real Winner for the Whole Family!	The kids had a solid hour of almost constant laughter and fun, and the grown-ups had fun as well.  This would be great for a group of children.  For each color of jelly bean there is one normal flavor and one weird flavor, and you can't tell which one you've gotten until it's too late.  Some of the weird flavors, like Toothpaste and Pencil Shavings, are simply unusual. Others, such as Centipede, Rotten Egg and Skunk are truly VILE!  The spinner really helped the kids use this as a game, and they loved it and still talk about it.	3	0
1	B000NJMV14	A383XURHVF8ON6	Excellent grain-free treats!	"These treats are the bee's knees. I've bought them in EVERY flavor they offer. Lamb liver is a great flavor, but my pups love all the flavors equally, it seems. Each treat is about 1"" wide and 1"" to 1-1/2"" in length. Good sized treat for a bigger dog, and if you have smaller dogs like my shelties, these jerky treats tear apart easily into smaller bites with no crumbs, no mess. They smell like the jerky I buy for myself, and have quality ingredients. The shelties love them! I gave a bag to my sister for her giant dogs and they love them too, they work hard for these treats to get them out of puzzle toys.  My parents' little pom-terrier mix has a special place in her heart for anything liver, so these were well received (*snarf snarf snarf*) by that pup too.<br /><br />My younger sheltie can't handle grain or gluten... he has epilepsy that is possibly triggered by gluten, so I feed both furkids grain-free everything. Even if he didn't have epilepsy, I'd probably still feed grain-free, including these treats, because my shelties have *fantastic* silky soft coats from feeding them this way. I don't buy these treats here, I get them elsewhere, but they are a fantastic deal for 12 ounces of treats, it's a LOT of little torn-up bite-sized treats for my shelties during training. Each bag lasts me about a month, I think."	2	0

1	B004538TME	A1Q4MNIUESQTBM	Surprise! It's fantastic!	I grew up on Folgers coffee. It was simply the best affordable coffee that could be drank on a daily basis. I was glad that Folgers has formulated there distinct coffee for the K-Cup. A few years ago I did try using folgers ground coffee in one of those Keurig My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter and it just did not come out right. I have had no luck with the refillable K-Cup with any brand of coffee. I honestly believe that a lot of product testing goes into these K-cups. It's not as simple as fill it up and run water through it.<br /><br />Folgers Columbian K-cups taste exactly like I made it way back when with my Mr. Coffee. Becuse you are able to adjust the amount of coffee used in the Drip brewers this may or may not be as perfect of a match for your tastes. The one constant is the all important aftertaste. The Extra-Bold Newman's own and Doughnut Shop K-cups have a long, strong aftertaste that I really enjoy but they give you strong coffee breath. By comparison This Folgers has less of a aftertaste which Is nice when you know you will be in conversation with someone.<br /><br />There are many Columbian coffee K-cup choices and in reality they are all good. If you loved Folgers in the past. You won't be disappointed.	0	0
1	B0053T1688	A2WMTMNHWTYXMI	My Maggie Lives for Her Treatie-Time	"My Maggie L-I-V-E-S for Her Treatie Time<br /><br />Every evening, after the dogs have eaten and played outside until bedtime, it turns into ""Treatie-Time."" Both of my girls, Lucille and Maggie, are allowed two treats, or sometimes three each if they really beg. They have to sit or down or do something special to ""earn"" their treatie, but it's a special time for us.<br /><br />I value my dog's health, as I'm sure you do. I want them to live a long time and have a trouble-free existence - no scratchy skin allergies, etc. Therefore, I've explored using organic treats, and have even purchased some expensive ones from a local dog bakery. I must tell you that the ""girls"" were underwhelmed with those treats. Despite their healthy ingredients.<br /><br />Therefore, when I was approached to review the new brand of organic treats for Barksters, I was ambivalent. Organic treats haven't been very well received in my household in the past, but I was game to try them again.<br /><br />I believe in organic treats, but if the girls don't eat them, it's really money down the drain. Especially since we're not depending upon the treats for total nutrition, I'm also concerned with treats being of the the low-calorie variety. I was horrified to learn that one of the standard biscuit-y treats contained over 500 calories in each one. That's terrible.<br /><br />As I opened the two packages of Barksters, one was Sweet Potato and Chicken Krisps and the other was Brown Rice and Beef Krisps, I was glad to see two things on the packaging:<br /><br />1.The treats are made in the good ole' U.S. of America. This is important, especially because of the recent pet deaths from pet food manufactured in China.<br /><br />2.The treats are wheat free and gluten free.<br /><br />The second is most important for my ""grand-dog"" Dutchy, the Siberian Husky. Ever since he's been a pup he's struggled with digestive issues. Our vet recommended that he have a gluten-free diet, which has helped him tremendously. We don't want to ruin his digestion with treats.<br /><br />As we spent the afternoon on the deck on a steamy Georgia Sunday afternoon, I broke out the two types of treats to see what the doggy reactions would be. I was surprised to see that the treats reminded me of rice cakes - very puffy - and wafer-like, instead of a biscuit. And, I must say that they were both a great hit with all the dogs. They couldn't get enough of them.<br /><br />The wafers tended to break, but that allowed me to give smaller treats more often to the group. They didn't mind if it was broken in two, that just meant two treats - Bonus!<br /><br />The treats cost approximately $10 per box which contained 5 ounces, which seems pricey. But, since it's a ""luxury"" item, I can go with the price. I was pleasantly surprised at how much the dogs liked these treats, especially since they didn't look like the ones they're used to getting for their ""treatie-time.""<br /><br />I'd highly recommend that you try Barksters!"	0	0
1	B000084ETV	A3JQJGYWQBACTW	Outstanding super premium dog food!  The best in my opinion!  I couldn't be happier!	I have been researching dog food for a few years now.  I am living in Japan (US Military) and I was ordering my dog food from PetCo online.  I have tried Solid Gold Hund N' Flocken, DVP's Natural Balance, Costco Kirkland Super Premium, Eukanuba FP Prescription Diet, and Hills ZD Ultra Allergen Free Prescription Diet.<br /><br />I was able to source the Canidae and the Solid Gold foods locally for my Dal with serious allergies.  Both of the foods have had better results than the super pricey prescription diets.  I am sold on Candidae.  I pay $[...] for the 40 LB sack, which is not that bad considering I am sourcing it locally on the Tokyo economy.  The dogs love this food more than the Solid Gold, but I believe that they are both fine foods.  This food looks tastier than the Solid Gold Wolf Pup that I was feeding my K9 German Shepherd, and it seems heartier that the Hund N' Flocken as well.  It just looks like it must taste good.  The dogs go nuts over it like a crack addiction!  I am very happy that I have found a solution that is applicable to both dogs!<br /><br />There is something to be said of companies that go the extra mile for our man's best friend.  It is just not right to feed our pets the crap that they sell in the stores.  I used to think that Eukanuba was a great dog food.  Thank God for the Internet!<br /><br />Buy this food, you will not be disappointed!	4	0

It goes really well on all sorts of dishes to add the extra kick.<br /><br />The sauce itself lasts a lot longer than it appears. It is thick and a bottle will last us a couple of weeks of heavy use.

My friend has a little Rottwieler puppy that had bad kidneys.  The vet said she would die soon.  We went into action and discoverd that Dr. Harvey's food is actually easy on her kidneys.  She has gained 12 pounds in less than 2 months which is a miracle.  She is playing again and getting very sassy!  I will keep my girl eating what she loves; Dr. Harvey's.

1	B0026RHUP8	A291TCX4BEY4JA	My Family's #1 Formula	"Enfamil Premium Lipil Formula is the same as the previous flagship Mead Johnson formula--Enfamil Lipil--except that it has ""prebiotics"" added in.  Our son was on Enfamil Lipil from September 2007-September 2008.  He was breastfed and formula fed during this time.  Our daughter, who is due in January 2010, will also be breastfed and formula fed for her first year of life.  We tried two other formulas with our son--Similac Advance and Parent's Choice.  The Similac was fine but clumped badly.  During the time we experimented with the Parent's Choice formula, my son was consistently troubled by colds and the flu.  I think the Parent's Choice formula lowered his immunity somehow and will never use it again.  I believe that Mead Johnson's decision to use prebiotics is a good one.  Our son had colic/acid reflux in part because his digestive system was not yet populated with the good bacteria for breaking down milk proteins.  He was a lot more comfortable after we started putting a little Culturelle (a probiotic) in his formula in the evening.  And since a lot of our immune system is in our digestive tract, he had fewer sick days after introducing the Culturelle.  Probiotics and prebiotics will also help infants rebound from the negative effects of antibiotics like amoxicillin quicker.<br /><br />Regarding the bpa found in formula can liners, I talked to an Enfamil customer service representative who told me that Mead Johnson now uses cans that are lined with a ""modified polyester"" that is bpa free.  Similac Advance Earlyshield comes in a bpa-free can also (the SimplePac container).<br /><br />Another concern parents have is the cost of formula.  Name brand formulas are expensive!  But if you think about it, you are feeding a human being for about $15 a week (a can usually lasts us 1.5 to 2 weeks).  $15 a week is peanuts compared to what a hungry teenager devours!  And with name brand formulas you are getting the absolute best product available--Bill Gates couldn't buy a better formula than what's on the shelves at Target or Wal-mart.<br /><br />If you are a new parent and feel overwhelmed by the infant formula section of your grocery store (as I was in September 2007), I suggest starting with the flagship formula of either Mead Johnson (Enfamil Premium Lipil), Abbott Laboratories (Similac Advance Earlyshield), or Nestle (Good Start Gentle Plus or Good Start Protect Plus).  They are all excellent infant formulas.  You just have to see what works for you and your baby."	22	2

I'm fortunate to live in a city that's known for it's coffee, so I'm spoiled when it comes to being able to get a good cup of joe. This Melitta Cafe coffee is the best, pre-ground, home brewed coffee I've ever had, hands down. As cheesy as it sounds, I even had one of those television commercial moments when I first opened the bag: I said ""Ah!"" and inhaled the woody and nutty aroma deeply. I was instantly sold. The coffee is ground very fine, allowing all the flavor to end up in your cup and not in the trash, garden, or food bin. Even when watered down to make an iced drink the flavor stays prominent. This would be a great blend for homemade coffee ice cream or desserts that use non-instant coffee as an ingredient. I would and have recommended this brand to family and friends."	0	0

-1	B000084ETV	A2VZIJHABHMIQW	Canidae made my dogs VERY SICK	New food and or changed formula's need to be introduced to animals slowly. Very slowly. However, I was not given this option by Canidae when I ran out of the old All Stages Life Dry Dog Food and purchased a new bag of the new formula (no warning label) with none of the old to mix in. That is the problem I'm having with my four dogs, 2 of which are 12 years old. Granted, the changes may be an added benefit to their new formula but it's NOT a benefit if they don't notify their consumers that there has been quite an extensive change (19 additional items) to their recipe.  Meanwhile, I've had to deal with 4 dogs who have been vomiting and have bloody diarrhea as well as vet bills for the past 17 days because of Canidae's neglectful oversight on not informing their consumers. I just found out about the NEW formula 2 days ago while researching Canidae on the web and found more disgruntled consumers.  That is why I give them 1 star.  The one good thing I can say about Canidae (their old formula was great by the way) is thank God this can't be compared to the recall of last year that killed thousands of pets.  By the way, what WAS wrong with the old formula????	6	1

I don't love the Cheddar or the Salt and vinegar, they are a bit strong.<br /><br />If you are on weight watchers each bag is 2 points, and are a great find to cover the crunchy/salty crave, If you are not on weight watchers, you will still enjoy them.

1	B0007OVWLU	A3BLQEPBH0XB1A	Just as I remembered	This product is exactly as I remember it as an adolescent in the 70's. Once you get past the first couple of pieces, you will find different flavors for each color, red and white for Cherry, purple and white for grape, and yellow and white for banana.  Other color combinations have different flavors, some hard to identify but all good.  If the weather is a bit warm, the wax paper can be a little hard to separate from the taffy.  Quick Fix - stick them in the refrigerator for a two minutes and the paper will come off easily.  Makes a great treat for kids.  Adults, watch out for the expensive dental work. This taffy is the real stuff.  Enjoy!	3	0
1	B0088JR9PY	A2SQGC708613E4	Good quality product.  A little goes a long way.	If you like authentic pad thai, satay, or chutney, you need tamarind paste.

Eight ounces will last you a long time.  This brand is cheap, too, and that is always nice.	0	0
-1	B003EML8PM	AVEMWTYR60X3W	Lawrey's Microwave Pork rinds review	The Lowrey's Microwave Pork rinds that I received was unacceptable.  I ordered 36 bags and the bags only popped 1/4 of the bag.  All rinds popped but for the amount of the money that I paid for them I could have gone to the store and bought a $2.00 bag already popped and gotten a full bag.  I feel that it should have popped at least half of the bag.  I understand that everyone is counting their pennies but I also think that the consumer should get something for their money.  I really enjoy this product but I probably will not order any more for this reason.	0	1

-1	B002XHFG70	A2Q79J76PISBAJ	Crammed full of Sugar - 21g per serving, 168g per can	I spent days trying to find decent mango puree in order to make mango shakes, and since I'm a health nut, I try to control my sugar intake. Every mango puree I look at is full of sugar, and this brand is no different. 21 grams of sugar per serving, and an amazing 168 grams for the entire can. An average can of soda contains 45 grams, for comparison. I know they make unsweetened mango puree, but I can't find it.<br /><br />Other than that, it's a decent enough product if you don't care about unnecessary sugar intake. Nice and creamy, good product from good fruit. Very sweet, but these manufacturers don't understand that you don't need to add so much sugar to a naturally sweet fruit! There IS a market for unsweetened fruit, guys.	5	0

I take at least 2 bags in 6oz of water to even taste it.<br />I also found the quality rather cheap compared to similar priced teas.  Here are just some of the problems I found:<br />1. Cannot open sachet without scissors.  Many are missing tear marks.<br />2. The tag falls off on half the tea bags.  So you end up fishing the bag out of your tea.<br />3.

1	B004YV7LIK	A2JA2RLQXBWMCY	MMMMMmmmmm	YUM. Really, I can see how people use this as a replacement for coffee. I think it tastes similar, but not really just like coffee. It is incredibly tasty, though. I have only tried this flavor, as the spicy chocolate was right up my alley. It isn't all that spicy when prepared, though, unless you make it uber-strong. I made the mistake of getting this package-- didn't realize it was the espresso grind--it is pretty fine, and I was using a strainer at first and now a french press, neither of which removes all the tiniest particles. It works just fine in a drip coffee maker, though--I tested it with my mom's. I would get the coarse ground next time, though, since I don't have a drip coffee maker. Other than that user error issue, it's a great product. Sweet, nice collage of flavors, with a similar depth and viscosity to coffee.	0	0

I realize this is not a review, let alone a ""helpful review"", as I did not describe the taste of the product or even review the product. I couldn't review this product, if I wanted too.  I want people with a corn allergy to be advised of the ingredients in the tea.  I didn't know how else to inform folks about the ingredients except for on the page with reviews.

I tell them the Kettle Brand does for potato chips what microbrew does for beer.<br /><br />Kettle Brand potato chips are unmistakable--a light gold color, rich flavor and amazing crunch. Kettle Brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands. Kettle Brand chips don't have trans fats, MSG or artificial flavors and colorings. The company also has a line of organic potato chips and all of their products are certified Kosher.<br /><br />Annette Solomon, a reporter for the Salem Statesman Journal noted that a glass of wine goes nicely with Spicy Thai chips. Solomon wrote, ""...you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing. These chips are spicy, so you would want to select a semi-sweet white wine. Also, a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger, lime, garlic and cilantro without over-powering them. Classically, a German-style Riesling fits these parameters perfectly.""<br /><br />I also recommend <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6MBV4"">Kettle Chips Honey Dijon</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6MBUA"">Kettle Chips Sea Salt & Vinegar</a>.<br /><br />The Honey Dijon chips bring a terrific balance of salty, tangy, sweet and crunchy. Other brands I've tried use too much mustard flavor, which overpowers the Honey Dijon pairing. The Honey Dijon chips make a great side dish on a BBQ plate with baked beans, coleslaw or potato salad and grilled meat. Naturally, they also go down great with beer.<br /><br />The Sea Salt & Vinegar chips are a perfect complement to vegetable trays of cucumber, carrot, celery and cherry tomatoes. Skip the dip; balance the tangy chips by alternating bites of raw vegetable.<br /><br />In summary, I highly recommend Kettle Brand chips, a great buy on Amazon.com."	1	0

One ounce contain approximately 20% of the RDA for an adult recommended dietary allowance (RDA)<br />Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) the amounts of selected nutrients considered adequate to meet the known nutrient needs of healthy people. The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The Canadian equivalent is the Recommended Nutrient Intakes. RDA is generally accepted throughout the world as a valid source of information. At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.<br /><br />Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women.

1	B003VXFK44	A2LNPSDCRPQ1DW	Very Good Coffee	I got this with the purchase of 24 different bold coffee k-cups to find the ones I like best, and so far this is my favorite. It may not be bold enough for some, but it is not supposed to compete with the 'extra bold' varieties. This was smooth and not nearly as bitter as many bold coffees. So many bold blends have a 'burned' flavor, leaving a bad taste in your mouth, this one was strong without the bad aftertaste, perfect for me!	0	0

1	B00390T5JA	A1OXFPXM2OE7ID	Super Coffee Maker	Simple to use, intuitive to set up. Makes great coffee and tea, provided you use your preferred brands. Fits on the kitchen counter, does not take up extra space, reservoir holds a decent amount of water so you can have more than one cup, or provide cups for guests without filling reservoir over and over. Great item.	0	0
1	B000G6RYNE	A3RMGIKUWGPZOK	Great Chip!	"With Kettle Chips, you really have to be careful.  Some of their flavors are nauseating.  With that said, they DO make fantastic plain chips.  Thick cuts of potato, fried to a dark golden brown.  They are crunchy and lightly salted with sea salt.  I can't recommend these chips enough.  You won't regret it.<br /><br />Some people say they are burnt but they aren't.  From their website: ""Take a quick look and you'll see an immediate difference: Kettle Brand® Potato Chips are a beautiful tawny gold. During cooking, the natural sugars of our select potatoes caramelize, creating chips from light gold to a deep amber.  The results are flavors as deep and rich as the colors, and an artisanal display in every bag""<br /><br />Some have also said that these chips are oily, which is true.  But they explain that on their website: ""At Kettle Foods we exclusively use expeller pressed high monounsaturated sunflower and/or safflower oil to make Kettle Brand®  products. Both of these oils are naturally free of trans fatty acids and are not hydrogenated in any way. We have taken the extra step of sending our products to independent third party labs to test for the presence of trans fats and results indicate we are ""trans fat free"" meaning none were detected. You will see zero trans fats listed on our packaging.""  That oiliness is natural and happens when quality oil is being used.<br /><br />You will not find chips with such a natural potato flavor.  I'm also a fan of their unsalted potato chips.  For those of us watching our salt intake, the unsalted chips is the best you can get.  Period."	2	0

They really aren't that bad in terms of calories at 180 cal. for the whole box and they take a while to eat and that's always a good thing when you are watching your calories.<br /><br />They taste yummy (sweet and sour) and in terms of treats, they are in my top ten for sure.	1	0

1	B002UQ7NP2	A1C7W4ROPPQVAM	This is my favorite tea	When I read the other review of this tea, I had to write.  This tea has a wonderful, balanced flavor that mixes the tartness of raspberry and the sweetness of peach to come up with a smooth blend.  I usually want a little honey in my tea, but this one doesn't really need it.  Makes a great iced tea, too!	2	1
1	B004UZWHPC	A1P2XYD265YE21	Herbal Tea: 5 Fruit Flavors	Celestial Seasonings is one of my favorites, if not my favorite, brands of tea.  Fruit herbal teas are my favorite type.  I love this sampler box of herbal teas.  The five types of tea, in order of my favorite flavors, are: Country Peach Passion, Black Cherry Berry, True Blueberry, Raspberry Zinger, and Wild Berry Zinger.<br /><br />I love tea, especially when eating certain foods, but also I love it all by itself.  I love tea with most all kinds of foods, especially cornbread or country foods.  It also goes good with most all other ethnic foods.<br /><br />I usually drink my tea plain (no sugar).  Very, very seldom do I add sugar.  And when I do, it is a very small amount.  Where I grew up, sugar in tea is an option.  However, I was stationed in the Deep South, and they drink thick sugar water with a drop of tea in it.  When my daughter was in elementary school, her teacher had the audacity to bring me a glass of that thick sugar water; I gagged.  I couldn't get past the first sip.  She might have gotten her feelings hurt.  They think you are crazy if you prefer tea with no sugar.<br /><br />Highly recommended if you like fruit herbal teas.	1	0

The last batch I bought is darker in color to the point of almost being burnt and smells a lot more.  It made my Mini-Pincher sick to the point of vomiting and liquid stools.

-1	B000121BY6	A3BOGELRQJK8OE	Like Something You might find for sale at a four year olds juice stand	"I, too, first tasted this at a ""caf&eacute; next to the Moulin Rouge in Paris"" it was about 90 degrees and reminded me of water from a hose washing over an old orange in the middle of the Sahara on a rather off day. In fact I venture to guess that's how its made with the bubbles that are there by some process of heat related fermentation.<br /><br />My experience in 1976 after ordering was regretting the 4 bucks just spent getting it, but I defend myself by saying I was so thirsty and hoping for a cold drink. Ha ha. I was later to realize that o get that kind of experience you had a better shot by freezing bottles of water in the US, putting in dry ice and hoping for a positive customs experience. That was a far, far better way to obtain a cool drink. At least in Vienne France if gave the nice inn keeper a twenty I got free use of a tiny fridge, which he found remarkably strange to use for my juice, colas or water. But that's off topic.<br /><br />Here's what you get for the almost four dollars per bottle, a weak watered slightly sweet beverage with a cross of what I hold is a mandarin and orange pulp, minor amount of pulp, some rather dingy looking stuff that's settled in the bottom that's grainy and a lot of off carbonated water. It's what my husband calls (poor word) water, but he likes them. For him they fill a sentimental niche. For me they say....France was very expensive.<br /><br />But I adored much about the travel and the country. I do like the bottles. I save them, peel off the labels and use them for rosemary in oil and other kinds of herbed oils I like to make. So if he'll drink it up, or I can pawn it off on some unaware visitor then I've got a nice bottle to use making bath oils. Great for lavendar scented bath potions.<br /><br />If you love it, give up on me in this regard. This is not a Sam-I -Am-Moment for the two of us. I would not, could not on one foot, in a bar, by a car, I will not, should not in cathedral, for a beagle or by that icosahedral. I can not drink it, Sam You Are, I do not like this watered juice in jar."	2	11

-1	B00390T5JA	A2IEHZ4L9Y6OTP	Update: Don't love it so much anymore	"Exactly what I wanted. My parents have an upgraded version, but I'm perfectly content with this mid-range unit.<br /><br />One thing to note, if you look at the picture of the box, there's a coupon there for a free box of coffee, which you cannot use - it's to be used only in conjunction with a physical purchase of the unit, which is kind of a bummer, to be honest.  But to be fair, it's not listed as part of the description, only something you'd notice if, like me, you looked at the picture of the box very closely before your purchase.<br /><br />I'm hoping it holds up well, because all of a sudden I am drinking A LOT more coffee!<br /><br />UPDATE: GRRR! So. Many. Problems.  First problem was all of a sudden it started making super weak coffee - Xtra bold, french roast, whatever, it was weak.  A little googling suggested that maybe the seal wasn't tight at the top needle. A bit of fiddling with the silicon doughnut seal seemed to fix that. I was back in love.  (FWIW, Keurig's customer service just sent me a free box of coffee as their ""fix."") Now in the last week it's begun the dreaded ""half cup"" syndrome.  I've only had it about a month and had already descaled (attempting to fix the weak coffee problem from before), but descaled again and cleaned the needles, and that seems to help, for about four cups. Then the damn thing brews half cups again. Grrrrr.  I suspect it'll be on its way back to Keurig this week - thank goodness I remembered to register & kept the box.<br /><br />I'm sorry folks, but for the price of these things I expect better. Much better - like a unit that works. Imagine how picky I am."	5	2
1	B00094HIZC	A1EKJ0GL6DLJZ2	Excellent, but try to find it elsewhere	This product is excellent. At my local store, they struggle to keep enough on the shelves. It is usually priced at $4.99 for 4 bottles, which is expensive as it is. I would try not to spend more than this.	0	0
-1	B0078Y6OX8	A26KIIZZT3AV1Q	Agravating K-Cups	Well, I really wanted to like these but can't. The coffee itself was just ok. Faint smell of vanilla was there as was the taste. My biggest problem with these was the fact that about 1 in 4 plugged up my brewer. I had to take out the K-Cup carriage and stick a paperclip through the hole in the probe that pierces the bottom of the cup due to coffee grounds plugging it up. It seems that the built-in filter in these is bad because the grounds come out and plug the machine. I have tried many other K-Cups and these are the only ones that have ever done that.	2	0
1	B0038ACQO2	A17DZ7UJ15L3GB	Best Pretzels Ever!

1	B001EPPD84	A2AZXEP8SYNJP7	Secret Ingredient	"I only bought a dram of the Champagne flavored oil to try it. I used the dram of flavoring in my nieces wedding cake and everybody raved about it.  A couple of people really tried to guess what the flavor was, but they couldn't quite put their finger on it.  My sister and nephew both said it tasted like banana and that it was great.

1	B000E1FXLG	A22Z9R91N8L7IQ	One Of The Better Flavors	If you've never used these mixes before, they're easy enough even for a lazy oldtimer who doesn't like to spend time in the kitchen.  I'll sit in front of the TV and spend two minutes whisking it up on the coffee table, right in the measuring cup itself, which makes it easy to pour into a bowl or bowls.  I usually fix two packages at a time, so use my four-cup Pyrex, available on Amazon (geesh, that sounded like a commercial).<br /><br />The result is... well, much more than worth that two minutes.<br /><br />Flavor is a matter of taste; but, for me, this pistachio is one of their better flavors.  You won't find big chunks of nut floating around; but there are enough little granules to remind you that this is pistachio.<br /><br />Unless you don't feel like a nut, I'll recommend this flavor and this easy dessert.	2	1

This time, the origin is not mentioned on the bag, and when I checked their website, I see they've written a bunch of malarky about how porcinis'taste the same wherever they're from, even from North America or China. That is just not true. Porcini from Europe taste better: the terroir changes the mushroom's flavor considerably, just as it changes the flavor of grapes made into wine. Since JR Mushrooms refuses to reveal their country of origin, I must assume they are selling cheaper, possibly contaminated mushrooms from China in order to make a bigger profit. Beware! Buy another brand."	1	0

1	B000DZFMEQ	A1WT4C5BZHW8KV	Excellent GF Bread!	"This review is for Pamela's Wheat-Free Bread mix; some of the other reviews here are for other products in the Pamela's line.<br /><br />The mix contains several alternative flours: sorghum, tapioca, sweet rice, brown rice, white rice, and millet, along with molases, honey, and other ingredients.  The yeast packet is included in the package, but is not mixed into the flours.  2 eggs and 1/4 cup of oil are needed to complete the recipe. The label has recipes for pizza crust, bagels, and pie crusts using the mix.  I have not tried these applications, so I cannot comment on them.<br /><br />I love this bread. The mix makes a large loaf (I use the mixer method and bake it in the oven; I don't use the bread machine).  The bread has a nice, soft texture.  It is not crumbly at all.  I have shared it with several people who eat gluten, as well as others who cannot; everyone likes it.  The flavor reminds me of a soft whole wheat bread, and is slightly sweet. I keep the bread at room temperature, and it tastes great even without toasting or heating first - an amazing feat for GF bread.<br /><br />The option for making rolls (in a muffin tin) with this mix is wonderful -finally, a roll that looks ""real"" and tastes good. I let the loaf bread cool fully before cutting it, but the rolls can be eaten piping hot, right out of the oven.  The rolls can also be frozen and reheated when needed.<br /><br />Try this bread - it is so much better than any of the frozen pre-made GF bread out there."	0	0
1	B000EH0RU2	A8CYVX1OFJU1K	Never thought I'd be buying groceries from Amazon.com	My store stopped stocking this rice for some reason.  It is a far superior blend than anything else I've tried and so I Googled it and was surprised to find it here.  Great texture and flavor (I cook it in chicken stock).  The best thing about this rice is that it is ready to cook, no rinsing required.  With other rice blends it takes so long to rinse that sometimes it's not even worth the effort for little reward.  This rice has it all...flavor, texture and no rinsing.  A lazy cooks dream.	0	0

1	B008FHUDW0	ABAHKMFEHT8K1	Doesn't Bite back	I just received my order from 1 Quick cup of this coffee today and was never so anxious to try a Kcup due to all the raving reviews. I brewed it in my B40 @ the 9.25 mug size and added cream and a sugar substitute. This is a wonderfully blend; not harsh not weak and it doesn't try to be something it is not. I know that sounded a bit odd but that was my first impression. This is my third cup this afternoon so I would like to try another cup without the nuances of the other kcups on my palate<br /><br />Not to be redundant from what the other reviewers have written; it's very mellow yet rich and doesn't bite back and leaves no harsh after taste. Can't wait to try it later @ the 7.25 mug size.<br /><br />UPDATE: Well I just had my Caribou @ the 7.25 mug size and it was as delicious as the larger mug size. A bit more after taste but again not offensive. Though I read that this coffee is a medium roast, to me, it tastes more like a light roast which I seem to gravitate to. I will brew it @ the larger mug size just so I can enjoy it longer. Caribou differently hit the nail on the head with this one. So it wins a spot on my top ten favorite Kcups list.	0	0
1	B002TMV34E	A2XA8CW5DF4MNZ	One of the best!	I drink coffee everyday but I prefer home-brewed compared to those that you buy at the coffee shop. By doing so, you conform it more to your desired taste and strength and it is healthier, without the calorie packed extras you get from the regular coffee shop. Upon opening the package, the aroma is instantly enticing. You can tell right away just by the scent that it is gourmet coffee. Upon brewing, this is where it gets you salivating. The fine-ground Arabica variety of this coffee instantly gives you a strong craving from the Once you pour smell. it on the cup and have a sip, it gives a satisfying taste, bold and rich, trademarks of a true gourmet coffee.	0	0

I still brew other brands, but this will always be my go-to tea, especially in the afternoons or when I'm stressed out. I also recommend Brodies Scottish Breakfast Tea for those who need to kick-start their day with a stout 'cuppa'. Thank you, Amazon, for carrying this rather obscure brand (in America, anyway) and allowing me to stock up!	1	0
1	B007M83302	AC8C9PT59CDW1	Love these chips	I was sick of spending $1.25 per bag from our vending machine at work, and just don't have the self control to buy a big bag & ration it out.  I was thrilled I found these on Amazon as are so much cheaper to buy in bulk, and since individually wrapped keeps me in check for portion control. I love this flavor & now I'm stocked up for a few weeks, & will definately order more when I've eaten these.	0	0

-1	B00270Z6FA	A2QX0N9DN1V1NI	item is delicious; price is ridiculous	During my recent visit to New Orleans in June of 2012, I fell in love with Etouffee' sauce on redfish.  Oh my goodness. Delicious.  I picked up a few packages of the Louisiana Cajun Etouffee Mix, for $2.00 per package, and made it at home. It was fantastic.  I ordered the product on Amazon from a particular seller and for the price of more than 7 dollars, was delivered one package. The product description on the website did not clarify the number of packages to be delivered for this amount...I assumed three packages for that price. I received one package and returned it to them immediately.  You can purchase this product on line from the retailer for less than two dollars per package with free shipping.  So, avoid purchasing this via this seller.  Great product however.	1	2
1	B000PDY3P0	A3205PAR0AANJH	Great Popcorn - even 2 days later!	"I bought a blue foundation 8oz popcorn machine from Discount Tommy along with a case of this popcorn.  The smell alone - oh my!  Makes my entire basement smell like a movie theater!  The popcorn, after the 2nd time when I actually followed the directions and gave it some time for the bottom heating element to ""dry"" the popcorn, is fantastic!  I've seem some negative reviews regarding it being mushy - obviously they either do not have an adequate popcorn make that heats well enough to dry it after all the steam/moisture the machine creates popping it in the first place or they did like me my first time through and couldn't wait to eat it immediately!  This popcorn is even good 2 days later if you turn your upper light/bottom heat on for an hour or so first to freshen it up - still tastes like it did the 1st day!  Leave out the ""powder"" bit and go to food.com and search for ""Best Seller Caramel Corn"" for a real treat!!!"	0	0

After the pet food issues of a few years ago I switched to only organic dog food for her.  Since she is only 10 lbs the price difference isn't too bad.  I am a free feeder which isn't ideal but means my dog basically has access to food any time she wants it.  Because of this she only gets really excited when ""people"" food is offered to her.  Well when I open this bag she comes over and eats asap.  Good enough for me!"	0	0

-1	B002GWMA08	A17GPYNPECW565	Truly AWFUL!	I rarely post a product review, but I feel that I would be irresponsible as a consumer if I did not comment on the Tanzania Peaberry whole coffee beans. I had high hopes when purchasing this coffee and I did my best to tolerate them. To illustrate, I have consumed almost one whole bag of the three, but will have to dump the other two in the trash! The beans are stale, dry, over-roasted, with little flavor. Even loading up the coffee with sugar does not seem to help! I resolved that this morning would be my last cup! I will have to resort to buying the Eight O'Clock brand at my local grocery store. I even briefly considered giving the two unopened bags to a friend, but decided that it wasn't worth alienating him!

On the second day I gave her the toy, partially filled with kibble and went upstairs. In the 25 minutes she was unsupervised, she got the screw cap off, ate all the kibble, and destroyed the bottle.	0	0

1	B001E5DZTS	A2POXXIULDRW44	The most convienent way to store and drink goats milk	We have been using Meyenberg's powdered goat milk for several years.  We used to buy their milk in cartons at Walmart and it was good.  The only problem was that we live so far from a Walmart store that we would run out of goat's milk between trips.  We decided to try the powdered and found that it mixes and stays mixed very well and tastes exactly like the liquid milk in the cartons.  Of course it stores easily and indefinitely and we highly recommend it to anyone who wants or has to drink goats milk.	6	0

-1	B003VXFK44	ALMBZNEFJT6VZ	yuck	This was the nastiest flavored coffee I have ever had in kcups. I purchase many different kinds of flavored coffee and caramel is my favorite but this one made me gag. It smelled like buttery cheese and the taste was not what I expected. I will stick to gloria jeans and timothys flavored coffees. This was my first wolfgang puck kcup and will be the last I order of his brand. I thought maybe I got a bad cup but I brewed 3 and I opened the other box and tried those since it comes with two boxes and same nastiness.	0	0
1	B004DP0D32	A22PF1TWWOEHUN	Should be called Spicy Ranch	The seeds are large and roasted perfectly. I lived in Upstate NY near Buffalo when the Buffalo wings phenomenon started and have been eating them ever since. These seeds don't even have the faintest resemblance to Buffalo wings. If you are looking for that taste don't buy them.  If you are looking for a great spicy ranch taste then these are for you.  The only flavored seeds available near me are the plain ranch. They are ok, but these have that extra bit of spice that really makes them great.<br /><br />Will be buying these again and highly recommend them to anyone who likes the spicy, yet not too hot ranch taste.	0	0

Everyone has mentioned great ways to use it.<br />My favorite....I use it on my salads, along with a little fat-free dressing. Now, I eat tasty salads every day, (without the cheese!).<br /><br />Sodium is 200 mg per tablespoon....and the amount of added flavor is worth every mg!	0	0

1	B001E2FMLK	A3F3B6HY9RJI04	Gave me a boost when I needed it	I had a very long day. Got to work early, worked about nine hours, headed for the airport and had to go through a connecting flight and about 5 hours of travel. And when I got home I still had some work to do and needed a boost to get me through it.<br /><br />After hearing a radio ad for this product, I picked up a two-pack and used one of them when I got home.<br /><br />It promised five hours of energy without crashing. I can't attest to the five hours (didn't quite pay attention), but it did last for quite a while and I had no crash effect in the end. I wasn't overly anxious or nervous, but I could think clearly and get the work done that I needed to get done. So it most definately delivers on its promises.<br /><br />The things that I like the most is the fact that there is no sugar. I also appreciate the fact that they use water instead of carbonated water, which is the main reason I don't like the Monsters, Rockstar, Red Bull, etc products (diet versions, of course). It also gives all this energy in 2 ounces instead of having to drink a large soda can worth of drink. The taste wasn't fantastic, but it could have been much worst and only takes a good gulp to get it all down.<br /><br />I've been looking for a product like this to get me going in the mornings and this seems to fit the bill. My only problem with this is that it is a bit on the pricey side. Today I am also trying out one that is similar, called Enduroshot, a 2.2 ounce energy shot that claims all the same benefits that this promises but at a MUCH lower price. I'll do a review on that sometime soon in the future. If I feel just as awake and alert as I do with 5-hour energy, then I will use it instead. Otherwise, Chaser has a new, steady customer.	3	0
1	B001EQ5IPQ	AIDUUBEUL3XHN	Sweet and natural tasting	I have tried three brands of coconut water and this is my favorite.  It is sweet, but naturally so.  Unfortunately the price is a bit high for me.  If it becomes available as a subscription and/or the price lowers, I will switch back to it.  I tried Zico and found it to be a bit sour and bitter for my taste.  I am using Roland cans now.  It is not as healthy as it has sugar and water added, but I love the coconut bits and the taste is good and the price is right.	0	0
1	B000KV61FC	A1XG5WYLFMRRX1	GREAT entertainment for my pooch!	My dog gives this one TWO paws up!  I was worried it might be too big for my little Maltese, but he LOVES this toy!  I especially use it when I'm going to be gone for a couple hours because I know it will keep him entertained and happy.  If we're going out for dinner, I put the dog's dinner portion of dry food (very small morsels) into the jug so he can play and eat while we're away.  I had been using empty bottles from bottled water for him, but they begin to splinter and break up after a couple of days and I worried about him swallowing broken bits of plastic (NOT good for the tummy!).  I don't have to worry about that with this VERY durable bottle.  It seems by looking at it that it would be impossible for the dog to get treats out of it, but my guy figured out within a day how to get out every last one.  A truly super item!	7	0

1	B004565GV8	AS31UPUVR0MZB	Very Tasty	Like other reviewers, I had low expectations for this gum, but was happily wrong.  I love key lime pie, and lime flavor in general.  When first chewed, this gum has the tangy-bite of key lime, with a creamy sweetness, and a hint of graham cracker crust flavor.  After the initial flavor burst fades, there is that surge of artificial sugary-sweetness that occurs with some brands/flavors of sugarfree chewing gum, but the surge isn't as overwhelming or long lasting as it is with some sugarfree gums.  Once that fades, the gum has a mellow, subtle, lime zest flavor.  I really like this gum.	0	0

1	B005H3BYHI	A21FY4Y4M5DB2X	Love this stuff!!	This brand is a little hard to find in stores as i don't think it's carried by any of the major supermarket chains. I discovered it at Au Bon Pain and noticed that unlike other brands I've tried, this one is not from concentrate and has nothing added, it's just pure unadultered coconut water, so the quality can't get much better. The other thing i really like about it is that it's a glass container rather than paper or plastic, so the taste is not compromised. These things alone are worth 5 stars to me but there are a couple things I would suggest to make it even better. First, this isn't really pulp the way you would think of it from you experience with fruit juices where there's pulverized, very small, drinkable pieces floating in the liquid; these are chunks of diced coconut that you have to chew up while drinking. To me, this would be fine if they were all the soft flesh you'd expect from a young cocunut but many of the pieces are harder which is unpleasant in a drink. Second, 9.5 ounces doesn't go a long way, I'd like to see it bumped up to at least a 12oz, I'd then feel like I'm getting an adequate amount for my money and it would last longer and quench better.	0	0

1	B000084ETV	AWLA2SJ05MISS	Excellent dog food	I found this dog food after doing research to help my dogs allergies (2 goldens).<br /><br />My dog had terrible allergies,  she has been on Canidae all life stages for about 5 weeks now.<br /><br />No more itching, scratching, ear infections and vomiting. Their fur is silky & they are so happy & healthy.<br /><br />Use the food cost calculator. your dog eats less of this than many of the garbage filled brands. They also offer coupons on their web site. It really isn't that expensive.<br /><br />If you have cats we have switched ours to the felidae and can also highly recommend it.	3	0

Someone I knew gave me a bag of this because they knew that I love mate unfortunately this is the worst mate I have ever had. The stuff is not even smoked which is weird because that has been part of the curing process ever since mate has been drank. The best way I could describe the taste of this mate is if you had a pile of really moist grass (like if you cut your lawn) and let it ferment in a dark warm room and then brewed it. Not good.	4	3

1	B001BDDTB2	A7KDU1JALDMLK	My cat went nuts!	My fiancee brought this home from his moms and my cat went crazy! She inhaled an entire can in seconds and then begged for more. I completely grossed my fiancee out when I tasted it and let me tell you as someone who is an avid cook the Chicken Pot Pie is very good. I make chicken pot pie and reading the ingredients were like reading the ingredients in a chicken pot pie you would make or buy for yourself. The chicken did not taste processed. The first time I saw the can of food I thought it was gourmet tuna and had to read to make sure it was cat food. I can't say that I blame my kitty for enjoying this so much. We have a local health food store that carries it so it's easy to find for me but the deals online are amazing! I'll be going via Amazon from now on. My cat reacts to this the way she reacts to fresh tuna, she goes nuts!	0	0
-1	B000CMFVY6	A3DKBG5SW21NOC	Not as described	"There's something wonky with the product description.  It's a single bone, not ""3 slices per bag.""  And apparently there's no uniformity with this product.  Another reviewer said their bone was small, 4 inches.  The bone I got was HUGE, way too big for my dog.  I gave it to my friend's mastiff who enjoyed it but that's how big this bone was.  If you're a fan of roulette, proceed."	3	0

"Perfect tool for any musicians trying to make recording much easier at an affordable price.<br />Easy to open plastic case, medium sized, durable (People have said that the plastic body feels cheap<br />and feels easy to break but it's not true. The Icicle's plastic body feels durable and won't break if<br />you're not clumsy with it or break it on purpose). I only wished that the ""Gain Control"" had numbers or indications<br />of levels so I can turn the knob to the correct position for recording and remember it instead of guessing all the time. Sound quality is FLAWLESS! No buzzing noises or anything picked up really...just nice crispy sound recorded through a good quality microphone is all I hear. I hear no difference in it with an Icicle or a Mixer"	0	0

The last batch I bought is darker in color to the point of almost being burnt and smells a lot more.  It made my Mini-Pincher sick to the point of vomiting and liquid stools.  I am going to shop for a better product that is made here in the US . . . I have been looking at GNC products for Dogs and that is probably the route I will take.	0	0

-1	B0009JI7O8	AKHNCFO09GOG7	boring boring boring	"Reading in earlier reviews that these were genuine chinese fortunes, I served them with a chinese Christmas dinner and was greatly disappointed, as were my guests.  Three sample fortunes are:  ""Life is not a struggle.  It's a wiggle.""  ""Management is doing things right: leadership is doing the right things.""  ""If you're feeling down, try throwing yourself into your work.""  These are not fortunes, they are self-help mini-bites.  A fortune is:  ""Your love of travel will soon be satisfied,"" and it doesn't matter if they are predictive or not.  What matters is that they state a fortune.  ""Beware the dog in the corner house,"" would be fun to get.  ""Life is a wiggle"" is boring.<br />The cookies arrived on schedule, as promised, and in good condition in their individual wrappers.  All of that was as I'd hoped.  But content counts, in fortune cookies especially."	2	1
-1	B008ZRKZSM	A2LZ0V0MS6XQYI	I really wanted to love this product...	I was so hopeful that _finally_ a lower fat, great tasting peanut butter was available. But when it arrived it was a huge let down. Maybe if I were to add it to smoothies like some reviewers did I would have liked the taste. But using it as regular peanut butter was my plan. Unfortunately, it just didn't cut it. The flavor was weird. Not at all peanut buttery. The consistency was ok, the color a little pale, but all that aside, the flavor has to work or the product wouldn't for me. I guess it's time to accept that good peanut butter is high in calories and finding a lower calorie replacement is not in the cards for me. Oh well...I tried.	1	0
1	B004P4TL8E	A34CE623TDL7LU	HA!  This thing is AWESOME.	This drawer is just awesome for holding the K-cups when the boxes get nearly empty, and it seems pointless to store them on the shelf.  It keeps the k-cups nice and dry and handy.  Best of all is that the machine can rest safely on the top, giving it it's own little area in the kitchen, kind of like a little break room.  We love this, and the shelf we bought to hang on the wall to hold the boxes.	0	0

1	B0045Z6K50	A2E50O4GW1E8GR	Great cup of coffe; 5 cents more per cup that at Store	I really like this particular flavor -- always enjoyed the coffee grounds back when I had that kind of coffee maker.  This one is good too.  It tastes good either hot or iced.  The only downside is it's about 5 cents more per cup than if you buy at Walmart of Target where you can get 18 K-cups for $9.95 on sale sometimes.  Not too big a deal because it costs money in gas to get there so the price is on par and maybe better.<br /><br />The organic coffees just taste better and Newman's products are well made -- as if they really care about taste.  I highly recommend it.<br /><br />With amazon prime, it's good because you only wait 2 days.	0	0

1	B000F0JOSO	A1K7OUOZGT6EG3	Supremo!	This is really the next best thing to homemade pasta; especially Artichoke pasta which is very expensive to make. This is also a much healthier pasta than the average with 28g protein per half pound box. It's just amazing the flavor in this dish - when served simply with olive oil and garlic you can really get the flavor of an artichoke with the contrast of bitter taste and sweet aftertaste. Likewise it stands up to a full red or white sauce also.<br /><br />1 disclaimer: by no fault of the pasta manufacturer Amazon once sent me a box of pasta that had passed it's expiration date so just make sure to check the lot date on the side of the box and the end of all the individual packets.	6	0

1	B001682OOA	A3URTH6JKIMREW	King Syrup Rules!	I grew up on King Golden Syrup back in Pennsylvania, and have missed it greatly since moving west in 1978. Until recently, I had depended on the generosity<br />of family members to ship me the occasional bottle, which we would then use so sparingly that sometimes I would forget that I had it on the shelf! So nice<br />to find an entire six-pack for such an affordable price.  Tiny bit of disappointment when it showed up in plastic dispensers, as opposed to the classic glass bottle pictured in the add.

1	B001EQ582E	A1QQEFV51EMD7E	Colman's Mustard is the best!	I use Colman's mustard in several sauces that I cook with, and it is the best powdered mustard I have found. It gives a full bodied, slightly hot zing to the dish, without being too overpowering. Although it is quicker and easier to slather on grey poupon, that product is getting prohibitively expensive. These 16 ounce cans will last me quite a while, and the powder keeps very well on my shelf, while the other mustards take up space in my refrigerator. I bought this in the interests of economy, but there has been no sacrifice by my taste buds.	0	0

1	B0018CJJ9W	A29LLQMJP8BDPG	Excellent Allergy Response!	"My 10 year old cocker spaniel has been treated for chronic ear and paw yeast infections for the past 9 years.  He's had chronic, stinky black gunk in his ears and a black waxy substance covering his toes.  I would guess that I've spent thousands of dollars on vet visits, tests, shampoos, ear medications, wipes, antibiotics - you name it - none of which worked for more than a week.  My vet even tried a ""new"" process where the dog's ears were filled with some type of medication every week (at the vets - $50 a week) for a couple of months - but there was no improvement.  My poor dog has scratched himself raw and spent much of his day licking and digging at his yeast-encrusted paws or scratching his sore, smelly ears.  Recently, I've been bathing him every 2 days with Malaseb Shampoo (which did seem to help), but he had to stand for 15 minutes with the shampoo covering him, before the medication could be rinsed from his skin.  Poor little dog.<br /><br />While on a trip to Florida, I took my spaniel to a new vet who prescribed more ear drops, wipes, and shampoo in an attempt to help my dog.  The vet  asked me if I'd ever tried changing his food from Eukanuba, which he's been on since he was a puppy.  No vet had ever mentioned that my dog could be allergic to his food and it seemed so simple.  I found Natural Balance Sweet Potato & Venison at Petco and thought I'd try a food trial.  What a difference!  In the two weeks since he's been on this dog food his yeast infection appears to be gone.  His ears are clear, with no discharge or irritation and the skin on his paws is starting to look pink and healthy.  I can't believe the difference in such a short time!  He's not scratching, either.  The Florida vet had said that a food trial would require at least 2 months, but I'm seeing such an improvement in only 2 weeks.  Pretty amazing!"	15	0
1	B0018CJYPG	A3LHFJBWYOLWW9	Excellent, no junk, dogs love, great price	I researched all the medium priced good quality foods made of lamb and rice and this was the only product that actually had real lamb as the first product followed by lamb meal, then has rice, carrots, peas, eggs, etc.  Only nonfood items are the required minerals to balance diet and taurine and glucosmine.  More natural than the natural products.  Couldn't ask for more.  Plus comes in 35# bags not just small.  Definitelt recommend.	1	0
-1	B00653KJ5M	A2IMM1IOY8Y36C	taste just awful!	I've been Paleo for six months, as has my partner. We both found these inedible. All four kinds (which, by the way, taste nearly the same).<br /><br />I'm not sure what it is about them either. It seems like they would be good from the ingredients. But something about the combination of flavors just does not taste good. I kept trying them again, hoping that they would grow on me. They sure didn't. We finally tossed them.<br /><br />So, I would advise getting just one from a local co-op or something before you buy a whole bunch online. I sure which I had.	1	1
1	B000KV61FC	AUCEUTMJBY8MP	Great petsitter!	"If you have a dog labeled ""destructive when bored"" DO NOT pass up on this toy! It's absolutely the best puppysitter. It's been three months, but when I put her kibble in it I still know that she's good for about 20 minutes while I do dishes or whatever. I hate constantly kenneling her when I need to focus on something, so this has been wonderful because it lets her play so much longer.<br /><br />Pros-<br /><br />- Totally entertains her for a minimum of ten minutes<br /><br />- Can hold her dinner and then some, I can adjust her playtime with how much I put in it. The less I put in it the longer she plays<br /><br />- Easy to load treats in. just unscrew the bottom and you're good!"	1	1

1	B001BSBFUO	A1E49KFES4XN26	Best idea ever!!	My Vet prescribed Tylan Powder for my dog, for 2 weeks. She forgot to mention how bitter and yucky tasting this stuff was for dogs. My girl wouldn't eat it mixed with can food, yogurt or cottage cheese. I found these pill pockets and thought why not give them a try. They work great. I poor the powder in the center and mold the treat around the yucky powder and my girl gobbles them down.<br /><br />Best idea ever. I highly recommend these for giving pills, powders or liquids (they are water proof for holding liquid med's also).

I have wanted to, since this grain is immeasurably better for you than just about any other grain but I was fearful of what would happen when I did cook with it. There is NO NEED to fear it.

I've tried it with craisins, raisins, nuts, and sesame seeds and various combinations.  I like it plain because it works better for sandwiches; I do add ground flak seeds for more fiber.  I use my bread machine so it is fast and easy. The bread is very porous and jam will leak through to the plate. The bread is smaller than sandwich bread.	1	0
1	B0017I8UME	A2NH6XPAZG881D	Sweet with a nice kick!	Being a fan of Newman's Pineapple salsa for quite a while, I was looking for a comparable salsa.  This is one of the best tasting salsas I've ever had.  My daughters love it too.  They don't like super chunky salsa and the Berry Mango has a nice smooth texture with small mango pieces.  The salsa is not too sweet, just sweet enough and although it's mild, it has a nice little kick to it.  At this price, it's a steal!	2	0
1	B00284TR82	A2TN8RJEYR9SY3	Great creamer	This item arrived when it was supposed to. It is so convenient. You don't even have to refrigerate it. So, that is one less step you have to take in the morning just to get a cup of coffee. It tastes exactly like the refrigerated stuff. It is so good.	0	0
1	B0028VAQSU	ABFMLM8RX10NO	LOVE IT!	I am so excited about this product.  I have made Paula Dean's Apple Cake (half of the glaze), pancakes, Thanksgiving dressing, muffins and cornbread using this gf baking mix in place of the plain flour, salt and baking powder.  They were excellent.  My non gf family enjoyed them tremendously.  The finished products were not gravely or grainy. The taste was great.<br /><br />If you have never tried this, test it out in the much smaller size.  It is wonderful.	1	0

-1	B002XHFG70	A3I0LGNJG2ME1G	Good product, but huge dent in 1 of 6 cans	I have purchased this item in a larger can before and it is great mango pulp for cooking, desserts, etc.<br /><br />One of the six cans had a huge dent and it would have been obvious before pack was placed in shipping box.  Items were packaged very well so I don't see how this could have happened during shipping since the outside box had no signs of damage.  It is too much of a hassle to return all 6 cans because of one damaged can.  And I need one can for mango cupcakes that I'm making this weekend.  Due to anosmia, the dented can will probably be thrown away because I can't tell if it is good or bad.  I will probably not purchase this item again from Amazon and will buy locally if I can find it.	1	0

-1	B0062A87HA	A24FZ5ALYDEIDS	Starchy Pumpkin	Unfortunately, this product was not enjoyable. I've been using canned pumpkin to make soup and to add to tomato sauce, but they did not taste right with this canned pumpkin. It leaves a starchy almost gritty aftertaste/texture. My only positive comment is that none of the cans were dented.	1	0
1	B005O072PC	A2SBZQR76C5TXB	Tasty, and perfect sized.	I was surprised at the size of these potatoes. I have bought them at my local grocery store before and was disappointed that they were so small. These are perfect!! Tasty, cook just right. Love 'em!!	2	0
-1	B002MXSAD2	A3HFLGB1IK5UKZ	Used it twice, won't use it again	This tray is huge, bulky, and awkward in the freezer.  It makes 2 oz portions, which are fine if you want to feed your baby 2 ounces of the same food, but I like to combine one ounce of this with one ounce of that.  Also, the cubes are fairly impossible to pop out of the tray.  You can run it under hot water as other users have done, but that makes a big wet avocado-ey mess.  I prefer to use regular ice cube trays with some saran wrap on top!	1	0
-1	B000KV61FC	A3TS8HT1JBVCDU	Didn't work well for me and my dog	Based on the stellar reviews, I bought this for my Husky Shepherd dog, Juneau. He would get all the treats out of the KONG so I decided to get him another toy to keep him occupied when I was away. The first few days he attempted to get the treats out of the busy buddy were not successful. He would sniff, push, sniff, push. The hard plastic made a lot of NOISE. Sometimes Juneau would drop the KONG down a flight of stairs to get the treat. I didn't mind the rubber KONG bouncing around. But imagine hard plastic hitting my hardwood and marble floors!<br /><br />After a week of use, I had trouble getting the cap back on. I found myself being the Busy Buddy, trying to get the cap to stay on! We tried to like this product but it just had to go back. I can imagine this toy might be better for those with carpet.	1	1
1	B000I1RHMU	A22SE439WLUGWX	Chailicious	It's organic that is the first great thing. It is not just black tea. The green tea mellows it out. The spices are just right. Try it with a little sweetner and milk. Definitely better/healthier than highly sweetened mixes.	0	0
1	B004V0SPUM	A5X8Z0SV21H7O	A little goes a long way	I love this syrup, it doesnt have all those added ingredients, its not like dark amber syrup thats extra sweet. A little bit goes a long way. When i pour it on my waffles i only need to pour it in the middle and thats enough for 1 whole waffle. So if you think this little bottle wont work for big families you would be mistaken, i use half as much as i would with the fructose added syrups.	1	0

1	B003ULJJN0	APUEYLQYFBBLI	Makes Excellent Iced Tea!!!	I'm challenging myself to give up soda 100% this year, but I needed something with flavor to replace it. After searching online for Tea reviews, I decided to give this tea a try. I just made the first batch of Iced Tea and it's FANTASTIC!!! The tea has a clean, crisp taste and you can definitely taste the mint!! It's not overpowering but it's definitely there! I used 3 teabags , steeped it in a 2 quart pan full of hot water, added a teaspoon of sugar and let it sit. The tea really is very delicious, and leagues better than the yucky pre-made tea I've been buying at work. The tea is a bit naturally sweet, but it needed a teeny bit of sugar.<br /><br />I'm so pumped! Here's to a healthier 2012 with Numi.<br /><br />P.S. amazon prime rocks. Received the boxes in perfect condition.<br /><br />M~	1	0
1	B000KV61FC	A29YJFYIOKXMMK	My GSD's absolute favorite toy	I recently adopted Jake, a 3 yr old German Shepherd Mix from a GSD rescue organization and was excited to introduce him to a variety of new toys.  Most he destroyed within minutes. The Busy Buddy Tug-a-Jug is his favorite toy and keeps him challenged and entertained for long periods of time, while other toys get tossed aside.  He has easily figured out how to maneuver the bottle to obtain the kibble inside and it's adorable to watch how excited he becomes when he wins the prize...each and every time.<br /><br />I know that other reviewers have complained that it's difficult for the dog to get the food to come out. Perhaps the pieces are too large or the rope is not extended.  Keeping the rope fully extended for him, Jake is able to retrieve the kibble...not with complete ease...but with a little effort and determination. I would highly recommend this toy for a dog in need of a fun and durable toy that will keep him mentally stimulated.	2	0
1	B003WEHPHC	A1YUHLJ61J7C8I	Nothing like medicine	I'm not really sure why anyone, especially an avid sparkling water drinker, would claim that this is similar to medicine in flavor or texture.<br /><br />This is a nice product and I would highly recommend it to anyone - even those that may be weary of drinking sparkling water.<br /><br />Personally, I've been looking for alternatives to sugary soda products, but I can't live without carbonation. I really enjoy is product because it's not sweetened and it is a convenient size to take in a lunch. Overall, this is one of my favorite sparkling waters. I would definitely recommend trying their other flavors as well.	3	0
1	B006N3IG4K	A28R88QFHN203B	The Best Hazelnut K-Cup!	Wolfgang Puck's Hawaiian Hazelnut is the best K-Cup Hazelnut and I have tried them all.

1	B004Q7O92I	AVBT8RZHIDJXF	My greyhounds love it!	My Greyhounds 7 and 8 years old( both Brood Matrons) loved this lip smacking food. It has given them more energy and their coats are looking wonderful. In fact when you open the bag the food smells like fruit and veg. Changing to Annamaet grainless Salcha,which is small kibbles, from the old food does take a gradual process for the older dogs not because of its size, but because of its high quality. Lastly the company has never had a recall on its products, something we all look for today.	0	0

-1	B004391DK0	A16JQ47D4O5EVN	Disappointed - This is gluten free BUT NOT dairy free	"Reading other reviews, I was excited to try this mix since it appeared to be Gluten free/dairy free.  Technically, the dry mix is GF/DF but the basic pancake recipe calls for eggs and milk.  Technically I can use my own egg and milk substitutes but then I could already do this with so many other mixes.  I've found that mixes that request eggs and/or milk really are better with the originals not substitutes.  The best GF/DF mixes already include a substitute so the directions only require water and/or oil or other non-dairy ingredients.  In this case, I will return to my old favorite mixes by ""The cravings place"" - these are truely targeted for a GF + DF lifestyle.  That said, if you are not DF then perhaps this is a fine choice. It would have been better to have a print/picture of the back of the package to more clearly see that this is not a great DF option."	1	2

They would scratch and scratch on it and just could not seem to reach up and hit the lever.  I would get so frustrated watching them that I would end up pressing the lever for them.  I think they had me trained! Finally, after 4 months, they figured it out! They are so cute working the lever.  This is a great toy and I would highly recommend it.  It is very durable and well made.  I think I enjoy it as much as my puppies do.	1	0
1	B007TU219W	A222AFPVSGC98L	Natural Balance dog food Review	I was trying to help my sister find a food for her allergic Maltese dog who can't eat chicken, potatoes, wheat, and soy.

I'm glad Natural Balance keeps making options for dogs with food issues.

-1	B001CWV4PA	A19XUL326ED7R7	Changed their ingredients, taste awful now	"I used to love these crackers and bought them all the time.  Even my family members who do not have to follow a gluten free diet thought they tasted good.  Then the company started adding sunflower products to the ingredients.  I knew with the first bite that the crackers now had an unpleasant ""twang"" in the taste.  I gave some to the rest of my family not telling them about the awful taste. They ate them without hesitation since they had enjoyed them in the past.  As soon as it hit their taste buds, they said, ""YUK!""<br /><br />When checking out the ingredients, to find out what had happened to these crackers, I found the sunflower addition.  Unfortunately, besides the bad taste, I am allergic to sunflower products, so will no longer purchase them.<br /><br />I wrote to the company asking that they return to the original recipe, but never received a reply."	1	0

She encouraged me to give the plain version (just pure coconut water) a chance first, and by the second container, I understood the amazing qualities of this drink.  I felt so refreshed, hydrated, and healthy!  I later tried the kind with pineapple, which is also delicious, but I think the plain is more effective and purely refreshing when really hot, tired and thirsty, while the sweeter fruit infused version will be amazing as part of a cocktail.

1	B000FAAY4M	A10UV0T9R1U3RH	Bisto Favourite is the BEST brown gravy thickener in the world!	Bisto is hands down the best! My mother turned me onto it a few years back and now I wouldn't think of using a white thickener (flour, corn starch) for any meat or poultry gravy again!<br /><br />What's so fantastic about Bisto Favourite is that you can make as much gravy as you want even from meats that give you hardly any drippings. Takes no time or effort at all and never ever gets lumps. You can even pour it directly into already cooking gravy. Can't do that with flour! It's foolproof. Gravy made with this always has plenty of great flavor, color and body.<br /><br />I've only tried the favourite and poultry flavors but am curious about the onion one. Personally, I don't like the Bisto for poultry flavor. I use favourite for both meat and poultry gravies. It has a lovely flavor and color that really works with everything. Just cut back on salt when seasoning the meat because the Bisto will add some.<br /><br />What I also love is that I can make a little 'quick' gravy for any leftover food that has no gravy by simply putting a dash of Bisto in the bottom of the plate, pour a little water over it. Place the meat/potatoes/whatever on the plate and microwave. When it's done the granules have melted and incorporated into the water and it is much like natural au jus. I get a nice moist leftover i/o something dry and bland.<br /><br />You'll never fail at gravy-making with Bisto Favourite!	3	0
1	B00390T5JA	A1TF9EYT8FEPZP	Happy with it, but remember to DESCALE the unit!	I have had this model for a little over a year and am quite happy with it.  It functions well and like any Keurig product is easy to use.  I purchased the ecobrew filters since I prefer to grind my own coffee and it is far less expensive.  Recently however I was getting very little water despite pushing the button for the larger cup.  I had not descaled my machine as I only use water that has come through the Zero Water filter system and the fact that the descale light never came on.  I decided to descale anyway and after I did it is back to its normal performance level.  Lesson learned - DESCALE AS RECOMMENDED EVEN IF THE LIGHT DOES NOT COME ON!	3	0

1	B000RJARJS	A44K08ZPD9M9F	The best Turkish tea we could find in the US	When we visited Turkey last Xmas, we drank straight or honey-sweetened Turkish tea along with delicious baklava several times a day to make up for the cold. My boys fell in love with Turkish tea there. Back home, we tried to find some good Turkish tea. I ordered several kinds. After doing thorough testing (!!) we decided that this was the best tea among the 4 kinds we sampled!<br /><br />The taste: very clean and pure. A light, well pitched, fragrant component. A hint of sweetness in the background.<br /><br />We brew it in a cast iron Japanese tea kettle, pour boiling water in it, then dilute it in the glass or mug to the concentration we want. Purists beware: we often sweeten it with honey, and I typically add a drop of lemon:-)	4	0

1	B0000YQ050	A3TIZ7A06JYIVF	The Best!	I absolutely love this delicious drink.  I usually have it iced and top it with whipped cream, so refreshing and such a treat.<br /><br />Its so easy to make and tastes like a choclatey mocha thick shake.  We all love it and recommend this highly.  Have also used their smoothie mix...also excellent!	0	0
1	B003OB0IB8	A56HS2VNURVJ0	Great spicy flavor	I really loved the spicy flavor these had.  I found myself liking the broth more than the noodles which is usually the opposite.  If you aren't used to the heat this might bother you and if you like hot hot foods this might not be enough.	0	0

-1	B000KV61FC	A1WE4TVPN3PTQ1	Destroyed within 6 Hours	This looked like an interesting toy but was unfortunately destroyed within 6 hours of first use.  I do not recommend this for a giant breed.  This may be a good toy for indoor supervised use.	1	1
1	B007TJGZ54	A1AT0X7EL4X8VR	Good value.	Good to purchase in a larger quantity! Ease for keeping supplies in stock! Easy to obtain from Amazon without a third party involved.  Got to use my free shipping - yea.	1	0
1	B003TIVBSU	A1MJV7MEG7YXVZ	Great Price for a Great Product!	I'm constantly trying to find vanilla beans at a reasonable price. Often, when I do, they are hard as rocks, dry, and practically unusable.  I was so frustrated at Safeway where one bean was $13(!), dry and hard as a rock. The best I've found was at Trader Joe's, where I could get three beans for $10. They were decent...<br /><br />This price was SO reasonable, that I worried they were not going to be fresh/good/etc. I was wrong. The beans were incredibly fresh and supple. I'm using them to make vanilla extract and they have worked perfectly. They keep well in the fridge, so I'm using them in everything!<br /><br />The price is great, but there might be too many to use--if that's the case, then split them with a friend. Then it becomes one of the best culinary deals ever.<br /><br />Absolutely wonderful. I will buy these again and again.	2	0

-1	B0019QG5CG	A110JRCYDJJ9ZH	Don't buy unless you know you what your getting!	The first picture of this was very deceiving. The tree I was delivered was nothing like the first picture which greatly disappointing me but the thing that made me angry was the fact that the trunk of this small tree was slightly broken. It may have been the way it was packaged because it was awkward to look at but I got to get it out without further damaging it. The shears I bought were the only thing that was just like the picture though and works like a charm. I just don't recommend buying this if you don't know what your getting yourself into.	0	0
1	B003EML8PM	A1FC0W6D6CDQ67	Best thing since sliced bread	I have ordered about 6 boxes to date, I have only had a few times that they seemed salty, I think the shaking of the bag helps much on this. You also have to watch your own Microwave as to the time needed to cook, do not over cook them or they will burn and become hard. I like to dip in Vineger as well after cooking.(You hear the SNAP CRACKLE POP)Some like hot sauce on it too.<br />I found these in a food store the first time and I bought them as a joke, but after the first bag I was hooked! I'm glad Amazon has them because I can not find any local stores that sell them anymore.<br />I myself prefer the original flavor but this is more of a personal taste then anything else, many of my friends liked the Spicy. you have to love the warm Rinds.	0	0
-1	B003VXFK44	AMEEXXHSFDS3Z	Just blah...	It seems the flavor selection on Amazon has been limited these days to some variation of hazelnut, french vanilla or chocolate so when I saw this one, I thought I'd give it a try.  Never having had Wolfgang Puck's k-cups, I was hoping they'd be as good as the Wolfgang Puck coffee I've had in hotel coffeemakers that were a part of my room but alas, I was mistaken. I wouldn't say it's the worst I've had but the flavor is pretty weak and the coffee itself is too.  I feel like I'm drinking coffee that's been made with grounds that have already been perked.  In other words - the flavor seems to be already squeezed out of them and I'm getting leftovers.<br /><br />If you're looking for a weakly flavored coffee that doesn't really taste like much of anything, this is your pod.  If you're looking for better, richer flavors, stick with Green Mountain which sadly Amazon doesn't seem to carry anymore except through third party vendors who want to charge $60 for a box!	4	0
1	B001E6KBSK	A1J2FKMZPW32HV	Favorite cereal	This has been my favorite cereal for probably 20 years.  The grocery stores stopped selling it, so I've started buying it on the web in packs of 5 boxes.  I use them up pretty fast.	0	1
1	B004AFODLI	A1TWM78I835NGZ	The only whole grain pancake mix I'll ever buy.	I'll keep it brief.  First, I usually don't like whole grain, multi-grain, or whole wheat pancake mixes.  I bought this mix to put in a breakfast gift basket I was putting together and since I had to buy a 3-pack I decided to keep a box for myself.  Christmas morning when the cakes were on the griddle the whole downstairs was filled with the gentle aroma of butter milk and honey.  The texture is a little more than a regular pancake but in  a good way.  And the flavor.........oh my they're good.  Little butter, little Highland Sugarworks maple syrup and I was in heaven. The only negative I would point out is that if you use even parts mix and water it makes the batter a wee bit too thin for me.  No biggie, I just reduced the water by about 1/4 and all was well.	0	0
1	B000ELWDRI	AS0M9ICI0N1VV	Yummy!	I normally HATE canned soup but this one is an exception!  Great flavor and the chicken, carrots and rice actually seem 'real' - not imitation or over-processed like all the other canned soups I've tried.	2	0
-1	B001LGGH40	A26KHZE0HTS057	Not enough Kiwi or Berry and too much filler juices	The initial taste does hint of something, but then the apple and grape juice filler comes to fore and dominates the after- taste.  Comparing this to the Black Cherry drink, Kiwi Berry has a better taste and after taste.  However, if you would have told me that this was the Black Cherry flavor, I would have thought that to be true.  I could not note any significant difference between flavors.  The carbonation offers no benefit in the taste or feel category.  The price is high - about $1 per 8 oz can.  If I want juice, I'll stick with real juice without the carbonation.	3	1
1	B0016FY6H6	A14U2WTVE7B377	Very refreshing!	Just the right amount of blueberry flavor, and the tea itself is not overwhelming.

-1	B002RRLZQW	A2JP9E1H0SF392	Not a fan of the cocoa taste	"I would consider this strong coffee, but what is also strong is the smell and taste of cocoa.

As such, I cannot recommend this coffee at all."	0	2
1	B000F4H5FE	A3TLUNUYP4VOX1	good tea. reusable canisters.	"A very good quality gundpowder tea. The canisters are very nice, though rather wasteful if you don't reuse them. Fortunately they are very useful. I keep some in a hardware drawer for nails, tacks, etc. I keep a dozen in a drawer next to the stove for loose herbs from my garden or spices bought bulk. The containers keep a good seal for freshness, yet are easy to open. I label the tops and keep a ""disposable"" plastic spoon inside each for measuring. If you can't use them, give them away ( Freecycle, Craigslist)."	2	0

This is super high quality cat food, a huge treat for any pampered pussycat out there who likes fish. It makes a very nice change from all the tuna based foods out there, and I try to always have some on hand so I can vary my cats' diet.	2	0
1	B000KV61FC	A2W2F9QZJXTFYM	Great Thinking Toy	My Lab Mix loves this toy.  When he was a pup he had a hard time figuring it out and would get frustrated and just bark at it.  But as he got older he tossed it around enough to get some food out.  What really helped was sitting down with him and shaking some out, getting him to pull on the rope etc.  What you can also do is take out the rope if that makes it easier and then if they'd got the hang of it add the rope again.  Using smaller food helps too.  It was fun to see him finally figure out a strategy for getting the food out.	0	0

1	B000I6O548	AJIFY2Y8OHPY	Good Coffee	This coffee is the best I have ever had.  If you like good coffee you should try it.  I mix it with another coffee that is not as strong but the results are wonderful.	1	0
1	B000KV61FC	A60BP6AAMW2U7	great feeding option	"I received the first jug as a gift for my golden retriever (80 lb.), then bought a second one when I picked up a Wheaten terrier (30 lb). Both dogs enjoy working their breakfast kibble out of the jug. The Wheaten will eat until full and the retriever, true to his nature, can't stop eating and playing. They are able to almost completely empty the jugs. Their size difference changes their strategies a bit but doesn't affect their ability to play.<br /><br />When first introducing the toy to the dogs, I ""primed"" the jug by spilling out a couple high-value treats mixed with kibble (later moving to only kibble). The rope knot inside the jug can also block the entrance, so I was careful to make sure that the knot was well inside the jug. And I made sure to fill the jug about 3/4 full because the jug can clog if it's totally full and I didn't want them to be discouraged if it was too unrewarding. Now the dogs are more experienced, so I don't prime the jugs anymore. I am increasing the challenge by sitting the jugs upright and will soon be moving to asking them to find the jug.<br /><br />The container is easy to fill but the cloth rope makes cleaning a little more difficult. My Wheaten uses the rope to retrieve the jug from under the coffee table but I'm still considering removing the rope because of hygiene and because it blocks the jug opening.<br /><br />I recommend this if you have dogs cooped up indoors, if you have dogs that need to keep themselves occupied, and especially for large-chested breeds who gulp down their food (because the jug forces the dog to literally only eat a couple kibble at a time)."	0	0

Well, with these Greenies Pill Pockets - wheather beef or chicken flavor -they won't hesitate to readily take their meds &/or vitamins. To them, these Greenies Pill Pockets taste just like a treat & they eagely await to take them - actually sitting at attention while you fill the pocket with their meds. They come in two different sizes - one for capsules (these are the bigger ones) and one for tablets. Greenies also offers them for cats as well. I haven't had to give my cats these - but if & when they need to take any meds orally I will give them a try.	0	0

Both of my dogs are right now at what my vet calls stage two on dental health.  Stage four is the worst on his scale.  I am going to monitor and see IF just maybe they will either still be a stage two in a year or maybe better.  If they maintain at stage two I would love it.

Cooks well; no more smoke than cooking on any high heat setting, and I had some left over. I think maybe you should use less than you originally use of other oils as this does not evaporate the same.

1	B0013E21V8	A1VZ5LHEQQXV27	A truly natural sweetener...	As we try to eliminate white sugar, high fructose corn syrup, and artificial sweeteners from our diet, organic maple syrup is a wonderful natural sweetener. Have tried other brands, grades, and nonorganic. Highland Sugarworks is by far the favorite. We always go back to this one. Perfect on pancakes and waffles, oatmeal, add to a smoothie, drizzle on ice cream. With Amazon's autoship, the price is reasonable. It's delicious. (The kids still prefer the yucky table syrup with artificial everything. Oh, well. We are no longer buying that junk so they'll eventually appreciate the good stuff.

I'm sure glad I did because these are delicious! My whole family likes them straight out of the package. We've not yet taken the time to roast them.	2	0
-1	B003EML8PM	A5BQKJ2S5XN2	To salty, dident microwave right.	I am a lover of pork rinds so i was really looking forward to eating fresh ones, neathers to say they dident cook in 5 mins like it says it would and if you put it in that long most would burn to a crisp by that time, another thing that really dident appel to me is that the taste is like they poured tones of salt on them before they packaged them.... i wanted to eat pork rinds NOT salt, if i wanted to salt i would just get it from the salt in my seasons cabnet...very disappointed...	0	3
1	B000WMPGDW	A2LZ275796I57T	Exactly like in Argentina ...	My father grew up in Argentina and since he came to the States has been searching for the perfect dulce de leche that reminded him of his childhood. He doesn't have to search anymore, I bought him a couple of jars this past Christmas and he has been a happy camper ever since.	1	0
1	B0013NUGDE	A2GR5THM9PODIX	can't stop eating them!	these are great chips.  i like that they are low in fat and calories, but still provide a great crunch.  the bbq flavor is the best!	0	0
1	B003EML8PM	AWN422BQYHI3A	Totally Awesome snack - low fat/high protein.  Yum Yum	"I bought one (to try) based on the reviews for the 18-pack for $15.19.  They popped perfectly, tasted delicious (crunchy, not too hard, not too spicy, not too salty) and are a really healthy snack.<br /><br />ZERO GRAMS saturated fat.  Total protein per bag:  31.5 grams.  Total calories per bag:  210<br /><br />Within minutes of tasting them, I ordered an 18-pack.  These things fall into the ""Totally Awesome"" pile, for sure.<br /><br />If you like pork rinds and eating low-fat, high-protein snacks, this item might work out well for you."	3	0

-1	B002QWP89S	A3NKGRF937ZJ8Y	Very disappointed	I ordered 3 packs of 27-count greenie dog chews from Entirely Pets and have ordered this product from various sources for many years. I have now opened the 2nd pack and both were the same:  all of the greenies were stuck together in one big lump.  I had to forcibly pull them apart.  Although I didn't try them myself, it leads me to believe these are old products and probably stale.  I will not order from this vendor again, even if it is a buck or so cheaper.	7	6
1	B00473OV2E	A13KWQGEI9MHG0	Moore's Marinade, Gluten, low sodium and MSG Free!	This is a great product for those looking for an MSG and Gluten free product, and is also lower sodium than any other marinade or soy sauce out there! It doesn't compromise of taste either, I use it as a Soy Sauce substitute and have found it to have superior taste and it looks and acts just like any good marinade should. If you are Celiac or Gluten intolerant, or even just watching you salt intake, this product is a way to have your steak and marinade it too!	0	0

-1	B003EHCIMO	A1T3P8RCA2ETP7	These K-Cups Leak!!	I purchased a box of these and 30% of them leak when I use them.  I couldn't figure out what was happening, but after examining the cups, I realized that the foil seal on top was not sealed properly and was tearing when the coffee brewed.  There was water and coffee all over my machine and my counter.<br /><br />May have been a fluke, but no other K-Cup has ever leaked on me. I will never purchase these again.  Back to Jet Fuel for me!	0	1

1	B000KV61FC	A26HN4UMQCFF6U	So much better than a bowl!	The Tug-a-Jug has become our Hobbes' favorite toy.  We no longer give him meals in a bowl, but either in this toy or in a Buster Cube. We prefer this to the Buster Cube when we are watching TV because it is less noisy. The Tug-a-Jug is solidly constructed.  We've had ours for a month so far, and have used it nearly every day.  It is absolutely worth the twelve dollars it is currently selling for.<br /><br />The medium/large size hard plastic bottle is about the size of a large (32 oz) sports drink bottle.  As the dog tugs the rope and manipulates the bottle, bits of kibble - or whatever you want to put in it - come out.  You can also change the level of challenge by putting ping pong balls or other things in the bottle.<br /><br />Hobbes is a 60 lb Lab mix, and a cup of kibble will last him about fifteen minutes.  In a bowl, the same amount is gone in seconds.  It's a great way for him to have some mental stimulation and settle down in the evening before bed.  Because he loves it so much, it's a great training aid.  At a minimum, he sits politely to ask for it.<br /><br />UPDATE: (September 2, 2011) Hobbes chewed right through the rope a month or so ago. However, we removed the remnants of the rope and put in more ping pong balls to plug the hole. This way we haven't had to buy a new one and he still enjoys it every night.	1	0
1	B002ZVIP9K	A4LSO2S43S4QV	Ginger candy - yum!	I am a ginger fanatic and this is the best candy I have found. Soft, chewy, full of great ginger flavor and 'heat'! And the packaging is the best. With other brands I have tried, while they have been very flavorful, it was difficult to unwrap them without playing tug of war with the wrapping. These are wrapped in powdered parchment and then an outer wrapper, easy to remove and pop in your mouth. And the Amazon 5-pack price cannot be beat. I paid over twice this price in a local health food store. Stock up - they have a long shelf life!	1	0
-1	B000084ETV	A30E7VN59NDR0I	Beware the new formula!!!!	I have been an avid Canidae supporter for about a year and a half.  My breeder recommended it and I was VERY impressed with how my dog responded.  However, a few months back they changed their formula, (they also lessened the bags from 40 to 35lbs AND raised the price!!!!) and it is terrible!!!!  I went through 2 bags and couldn't understand why my dog was consistently producing loose stools, when she never had before.  Randomly, I found 1 bag of the old formula left at my local dealer so I bought it.  Immediately her stools firmed up.  Now I am again on a bag of the new formula, and again my dog is sick.  I am done, I will no longer support Canidae.  Do not buy it!  Do your research, at this kind of money there are A LOT of better dog foods out there.	1	1
1	B0011DQSFQ	A28DKZ6FH5F1OY	Cornsilk Tea	I purchased this tea because I have trouble holding my urine due to an illness. I had read somewhere that cornsilk tea was good for people with trouble in that area and I can say that it is true.  I can go to the bathroom with a peace of mind.  This tea is also good for edema, high blood, heart problems, so on and so forth.  Go and google cornsilk tea you will be amazed at what it can help you with.	9	0
1	B0016FY6H6	A3EKKE39YN92KZ	Great product!	I first tried these powdered green teas from Stash last summer.

I ordered a whole bunch and look forward to having refreshing REAL FOOD drinks all summer in an easy to make form.	0	0
-1	B001P3NU30	A3B2HH9SQEQPT7	Inconsistent Thickness a BIG Problem	First let me say my dog loves these, and I want to love them but the quality control on these remains a problem.  Every bad I have bought has at least 3 and often 6-7 chews that are about 3 times the thickness of the rest.  Anytime my dog has had one of the thicker ones, she has always vomited it up several hours later.  I contacted the co about this, and they said they're aware of this problem, and are changing the supplier.  I have continued to buy them and throwing away the thick ones, 10-30% of the bag over a period of several months, and the problem continues.  They are too expensive to throw so many away.  I don't understand why they don't correct this.  This would be a good product if this problem didn't continue.	1	0
1	B003X0PUGI	A1PHJ407GFTEWY	Yummy	This is such a nice change from ordinary ketchup. More pizzaz! I've been putting it on everything...... it's great on eggs and hash browns. I'm glad I bought 6 bottles. Shared some, and am going through the rest pretty fast. It's hard to find locally.	0	0

1	B00008JOL0	A1IEBBUWZLDAMG	Nearly Miraculous	"I don't usually bother with reviews, but these results pretty much demanded it. Our 9-year-old shepherd mix is literally a different dog since starting to take these treats. For the past couple of years he's been acting quite old - slow, not much energy, and often would have arthritic-type pain in this shoulders & hips. He would play for a couple of minutes and then lay down, totally uninterested in continuing. You could just see in his eyes that he was tired and old. A variety of supplements hadn't done much, and we felt awful that all we could do was give him aspirin for the pain. We switched his food to one with higher glucosamine, but it didn't make much of an identifiable difference. Last month, after he'd been significantly worse with shoulder & hip pains for a few weeks, I went online to research arthritis supplements and orthopedic pet beds (the last step before deciding to put him on medication). After reading reviews on these Zukes Hip Action treats, I decided to give them a shot and bought two bags on Amazon. OH MY GOODNESS!! It's been about two or three weeks now, and I am BLOWN AWAY. He's acting like a 5-year-old! He has more energy, he's jumping again, and his eyes look so much happier! That's the best part, to see him happy & excited again. Previously, it had been years since he would run with me any longer than about twenty minutes, and by the end of the run I would be dragging him behind me... this week I took him for a run and he went with me for an HOUR! And he was still ahead of me when we finished!! We're so hopeful that he'll be able to enjoy his ""golden years"" without the misery of a poorly aging dog. I'm completely a believer in this product, and we'll be giving them to every dog we ever own. (Plus, you just saved me a bundle on an expensive pet bed.) ;D"	3	0
-1	B001P3NU30	AO1YXU5QEBC2N	Not for large dogs at all!	Even while supervising my dog within 5 min she was choking one of these then I had to wrestle her to pull it out of her throat because she was throwing up her food and could not get it up.  Bad experience.	0	0

If you figure out the potential alcohol content, this kit would probably get around 7%, but by adding additional sugar at the primary fermentation, I ended up with 13%.

You get a bunch of boxes, but if you love bacon, there are a lot of uses for it!  I've made sour cream chip dip, cheese balls, added to mashed potatoes and mac & cheese, sprinkled on baked potatoes in place of bacon bits.  If you can dream it you can do it.<br /><br />The bacon flavor is not over powering, it is a subtle delicious taste.

1	B0062A87HA	AJ4N1F0LLV4F3	Delicious!	The color and flavor is both deep and bright. Really tasty.<br /><br />So far my favorite use is to stir in a little milk, along with some cinnamon, ginger & nutmeg, then pop it in the microwave for a quick and healthy treat. It's also good added to plain yogurt, or in a smoothie. Next, I want to try freezing it in ice cube trays (after adding aforementioned spices- and whatever else strikes my fancy at the time - maybe a dash of coarsely ground black pepper, or vanilla extract?), then putting it in the Vitamix along with agave & lemon, to make a pumpkin sorbet.<br /><br />Would definitely buy this again when it's on sale.

I pulled the small chunk out of his mouth. Later on at night, he hacked up and vomited another small piece along with his two earlier meals of the day. The piece was still super hard. It seems that they fragment easier than before after a bit of chewing. Will not be ordering again and will be returning my bag as the choking risk is not worth it.

So far I have made some boiled red potatoes and seasoned them with walnut oil and sea salt.  I also roasted some yukon gold potatoes and english squash with the oil and it turned out wonderful--the walnut oil gives it a great flavor.  I will be giving one can to my parents.

The item is intolerably stale, and there is no recourse - I am simply stuck with it!<br />I love licorice, and have bought Gustaf's licorice on Amazon before, to much enjoyment. What I received here is a junky plastic bag unsuitable to preserve the product, containing product that clearly is too old and has not been kept under proper storage conditions.<br /><br />Add to that, labeling is generic, and apparently this item contains wheat in substantial quantities, not what I know from my brand name Gustaf's licorice packages.  Those disclaimers on the item descriptions regarding ingredients may differ are utterly pointless and plain not ok. How does that do anything other than cover the vendor's rear? Clearly, customers get no choice, and might wind up with expensive purchases of allergy triggers.<br /><br />Strike one - utterly stale<br />Strike two - not returnable<br />Strike three - no declaration of ingredients pre-purchase, only offensive legal CYA<br /><br />[Just about every packaged food or supplement I can purchase in a store falls under clear FDA guidelines for labeling, food safety (storage conditions, materials, expiration date) - those rules are growing on me!]<br /><br />I am a strong buyer, and I shall refrain from any such purchases moving forward. Not only is it too risky and pricey if duped with degraded product, it is also an inexcusable trap  - who wants to get stuck with waste and have their  money taken?!<br />Amazon is not what I'd remembered it to be!	0	0
-1	B000UBDKII	A30QTPDG22CE0F	Chemical aftertaste - thought it was the coffeemaker, but it was the coffee	"Although it sounded delicious, I was very disappointed in this coffee. The coffee has a strange, chemical aftertaste ... cup after cup, not just once.  Even when it brews, it creates a chemical sort of aroma.  In fact, because our single-serve pod coffee brewer was new, I started thinking the problem was the brewer.  We assumed it was a left-over manufacturing plastic or metal aftertaste coming through in the water.  I even e-mailed the coffee machine maker (Bunn) to see how to remove the aftertaste.  Imagine our surprise when a month later we opened a new pack of pods (regular Colombian, not flavored) and were delighted that our machine makes great coffee.  When we made a cup of the Senseo Vanilla again -- back came the off-taste and aroma.  Perhaps it's the ""artificial flavors"" used?  Be forewarned!"	0	0
1	B008ZRKZSM	A3DDFG67CTADLU	INCREDIBLE WHEN MIXED WITH JELLY!	I first purchased PB2 in Manhattan and was so excited about its great taste that I bought another four jars and mixed spoonfuls for colleagues at work. You can use PB2 as others have suggested, but I like it on sandwiches. My entire life I've been addicted to peanut butter, so much so that during college I ate 4 lbs of freshly ground health store peanut butter per week! I find that when I mix 2 TBSP of PB2 powder with jelly and put it on a sandwich it tastes as good as any peanut butter sandwich I've ever had.<br /><br />At 55, I'm blessed to be in great shape and have tried to stop eating peanut butter all together but it's impossible. So I'm here to order four more jars of what I consider to be a miracle: PB2!  Mix it with jelly (even margarine or a little butter) and enjoy an extremely low fat, old fashioned peanut butter sandwich.	129	5

Mayonnaise and sliced tomato on a cracker?? Try it, you'll like it.	5	0
1	B000LKXG8W	A2A8E70X0VXJT0	Great, as long as you completely forget about cheese!	"The first time I tried this, I thought it was beyond hideous. I was expecting something that tasted vaguely like pasta with cheese sauce. I had only recently developed a total dairy intolerance on top of the gluten problem, so was having very bad experiences with ""cheez"" & cheese subsitutes. Every one I've tried has been uniformly hideous, so it's not like I had high hopes for this dish. It is not even remotely cheese-like (or even ""cheez-like""), and hoping for something that tastes within screaming distance of cheese messes up one's expectations something awful. However, I found if I approach this dish after erasing all thoughts of 'cheesishness' from my mind & tastebuds, it's quite good. Actually describing the taste is a bit of a challenge...it's got tons of flavor, not hot-spicy but turmeric/onion/garlic/paprica/butterish/something... maybe it's the hemp seed that gives it the indescribable yumminess I can't begin to compare with anything I'm familiar with. Whatever the heck it is, I find myself madly craving it quite often.<br /><br />As it comes out of the package, it's not creamy at all , though one can up the creaminess by adding whatever milk substitute you prefer, & I've also added 'fake cream cheese' to it with decent creamy results.<br /><br />Still, I wish they'd get rid of the 'cheeselike' claims & call it something else; it seems to me it'd better prepare folks for liking it, thus increasing the sales, thus BRINGING DOWN THE PRICE, which is my main complaint with this & all the Namaste foods. I really feel like too often those of us with real, severe, dietary restrictions --who have no choice in a specialty diet as opposed to those who are ""going gluten free"" as a way of jumping on a fad bandwagon-- are being budgetarily scr....er, shafted by specialty food makers.<br /><br />If anyone has been introduced to Cincinnati chili as an adult without adequate prior preparation, the shock experience of this pasta mix is something akin to that. I grew up on Cinci chili & have a lifelong addiction, but if you approach it expecting something like good ole texas chili with meat 'n' tomato 'n' beans, your taste buds are in for one heckuva shock. Those with no preconceived notions frequently love the stuff, but it is very, very different from traditional chili, having been concocted by Greeks."	1	1
1	B0038T6O5K	A179QTQWJR86F8	A cook's latest obsession	I purchased this blend in a local market in Philadelphia for my foodie husband. He loves to grill and is an immensely talented cook. I often try to find him different spices and rubs to cook with and this has been a knockout win. He said it is the favorite gift he has received from me in that this is a delicious and unique salt rub. Keep in mind we have been together for 8 years and this is not the first time I have ever bought him something to cook with. He was amazed at the moistness (spelling?) of it and can use the rub for anything. Now, he is trying to order more and I just saw that Amazon sells it online. Score!	1	0

1	B002C4HZ00	A39XE1YC6ZBCZ4	Great Product, Awful Price	DOP San Marzano canned tomatoes are the finest canned tomatoes on the planet... but I can get these for literally half the price at my local grocery store. Is this unusual? Boston is pretty heavily Italian in some areas... maybe that makes a difference. i don't understand why anyone would buy them at this price.

1	B00375LB6M	A1XGFW5016CGQI	AESTHETICALLY PLEASING~~~~SPRINKLES!	Seriously, sprinkles are not just for eye pleasing aesthetics but for mouth pleasing texture.  This bag is great value compared to buying the smaller size shakers with different colors. I can use two of containers of  those colors on one batch of 24 cupcakes.  I just have to find a proper container to put the bag ones in so they are easy to shake out onto cupcakes, as that is what I use them for mostly. I'll check on amazon to see if I can find an appropriate shaker.  I may just buy a smaller one (about 10 oz) shaker and use and re-use that one.  My son and I like them also on ice cream, topped with ready whip canned cream. Gives pleasing texture to  ice cream. Yum!	0	1
1	B0032RPLSY	A3IU2PQXCUZPTA	Good stuff	I don't know if I have a lot of credibility to review this, since this is the first time I tried ghee.

-1	B007TJGZ54	A36AI28VXCIMNE	Do NOT buy from Mike's Grocers!!!	What I received today in shipment is a joke! I have the product on the desk in front of me. I see 4 packages of Green Mountain Coffee..Breakfast Blend. The 4 packages arrived NOT in an outer box! The packages are held together with yellow strapping tape. ALL 4 packages are ripped open in one way or another. One package has the bottom ripped off almost entirely and several coffee pods are missing. This disaster of shipping  was sitting out on my front porch in 95+ heat on a very humid Texas day. Mice, giant tree cockroaches, or kitties could have been prowling around inside the boxes. I can't believe UPS even accepted such a crappy packaging attempt. PLUS...I tried to find this Mike's Grocer online. The address on the return slip is 7 Prospect ST APT #4....an APARTMENT???? How do I even know where in the heck these pods originated? I LOVE Amazon and buy almost everything from them. This is my first REALLY horrible experience.

This is the best l have eaten since moving to the US 7yrs ago,my local Target has been supplying these breads for the past few weeks but are ALWAYS out of stock!!<br />The best way to cook your naan is in the frying pan...a little olive oil and coat your naan bread with water turn the naan bread over as soon as it starts to turn brown.. the oven method is OK..but wait til you try it the correct way ;)))<br />I am definately going to order the box.	5	1
1	B000KV61FC	AAXQSP6DYEBEW	Favorite toy	I usually am not one to submit reviews but after having used this product for two years I feel that it is definately worth a review.  I love Busy Buddy toys in generalfor my Cairn Terrier and this Tug-A-Jug tops them all.  The bottles that I have always had are in the size small and have an actual rope in the bottle, not the rubber rope as shown.  The actual rope lasts longer as a dog can't as easily chew through it.  A rubber rope of the same size I feel that my dog could have broke into two pieces almost instantly.  I have found that if the rope is broken eventually it can be removed and the toy is not broken!  I add a few ping pong balls inside the bottle and the toy works just as well, if not better.  My dog has enjoyed this toy from day one.  He is very good at figuring out treat dispensing toys and getting bored with them quickly.  The Tug-A-Jug has not bored him yet and it has been 2 years!<br /><br />Besides reviewing the toy itself, I would like to state that I have purchased this both at well known pet stores and here at Amazon.  In the future, I will only buy this from amazon.  It is the exact same thing for almost half the price!  Way to go Amazon, this is great.<br /><br />I highly recommend this Busy Buddy Tug-A-Jug to anyone who has a very smart dog that is food motivated.  5 stars.	1	0

1	B000DZFMEQ	A3RQJCTD2MMKEB	My daily bread	After figuring out that I was gluten intolerant about 3 years ago, I tried a bunch of breads (mostly frozen) available in specialty grocery stores, and a couple from dedicated GF bakeries, but didn't really like any of them.  I made my own GF bread for a while, using a Bette Hagman (Gluten Free Gourmet) recipe, and that was good, but quite time consuming.  Once my baby was born and I had no time to bake bread from scratch, I discovered Pamela's GF bread mix.  It's very easy to throw it in the bread machine, and it comes out great.  The house smells good, the bread is fairly soft, and it keeps longer on the shelf than the bread I used to bake.  (I still usually freeze 1/3 of each loaf, because it does start getting stale after several days.)  Now, I usually add 1/4 cup of flax seed meal and 2 T water to the mix for Omega-3s.	1	0
-1	B000YSS7EO	A3TX0Y68XHUKXQ	Not What It Used To Be	I've been using this cereal for the past 4-5 months.<br /><br />My son always enjoyed eating his cereal.  However, my last order (after the item being out of stock practically everywhere) of this product was different.  I'm not sure if the issue was a production problem or not.  However, the cereal now seems like shredded cardboard.  It tastes and smells differently.  Where initially is was a creamy color and nice consistency, it is now gray.<br /><br />I can no longer recommend this product.	1	0

The only thing bad about the Amazon price is they are about $20 for a 24 pack.  That is 80 cents each.  Sadly I discovered this great snack at work in the vending machine - for 75 cents.  I would expect to buy them for .50 a pack if I have to buy 24 and not from a vending machine.  I highly recommend these chips, but there is no savings buying the from Amazon.	0	0

For roughly the same price, the capsule version is far more economical. The pill pockets are huge! You can easily split them in half to make the bag last longer.

-1	B004K30HO2	A1AV9FXFHM50WM	Not very good for me	The basic problem with this product is that unless you load a VERY small amount of coffee in the filter, the filter clogs.  This causes the coffee ground and hot water to back up through the hole in the top and cause a mess.  My son and I spent a few hours experimenting with different ways to prevent this but we have admitted defeat.  I suspected the filter but I used filters which work perfectly fine in my EZ Cup still result in a mess on my kitchen counter. Even worse, coffee grounds in my coffee!  However, if you like your coffee very weak, this will work well for you.  I hope they can fix the design issues.  Until then, I will stick with my EZ Cup.	0	0

1	B001EO61AO	A2FD9B8CMYY78R	Very Nice	Okay. I'm a very accomplished home cook of some sophistication, but I'd never used duck fat. I wondered about the small size units, but I find that cooking for usually uses one or half of one unit, and the other half can be used plenty soon enough that it's not wasted. The taste is distinct and quite good. My first use was with some braised pork. I had made enough for two nights, and the product arrived for the second night. I sauteed the pork and carrots in half a unit of duck fat to reheat. The rich flavor much improved a dish that is anyway always better the second night. Half a unit was plenty. The richness was a very good addition to the pork and carrots that had been braised without wine and therefore somewhat plain. I see this as being something I keep in the pantry.	3	1

1	B0058AMY74	A3RMGIKUWGPZOK	Great Chip!	"With Kettle Chips, you really have to be careful.  Some of their flavors are nauseating.  With that said, they DO make fantastic plain chips.  Thick cuts of potato, fried to a dark golden brown.  They are crunchy and lightly salted with sea salt.  I can't recommend these chips enough.  You won't regret it.<br /><br />Some people say they are burnt but they aren't.  From their website: ""Take a quick look and you'll see an immediate difference: Kettle Brand® Potato Chips are a beautiful tawny gold. During cooking, the natural sugars of our select potatoes caramelize, creating chips from light gold to a deep amber.  The results are flavors as deep and rich as the colors, and an artisanal display in every bag""<br /><br />Some have also said that these chips are oily, which is true.  But they explain that on their website: ""At Kettle Foods we exclusively use expeller pressed high monounsaturated sunflower and/or safflower oil to make Kettle Brand®  products. Both of these oils are naturally free of trans fatty acids and are not hydrogenated in any way. We have taken the extra step of sending our products to independent third party labs to test for the presence of trans fats and results indicate we are ""trans fat free"" meaning none were detected. You will see zero trans fats listed on our packaging.""  That oiliness is natural and happens when quality oil is being used.<br /><br />You will not find chips with such a natural potato flavor.  I'm also a fan of their unsalted potato chips.  For those of us watching our salt intake, the unsalted chips is the best you can get.  Period."	2	0

1	B004KNEIMO	A3089UBNI6I5IK	A perfect little gift that doesn't melt	So I bought these to give them to homeless people on the street. They seem to really appreciate it. Nice thing about M&M's is that they don't melt into goo when you put them in your pocket.	0	0
-1	B000CQ25QE	A3HZ03L316GAIS	Nasty	I've recently decided to switch to eating whole grains and we picked up a box of this at a health food store as an alternative to the Kraft mac and cheese that my son likes.  I prepared it as per the instructions and the sauce was runny and quite flavorless.  After one bite my son wouldn't eat any more and after I had a bite too, I couldn't blame him because it was just nasty.  I don't have any problems eating whole wheat pasta and neither does my son, but we couldn't eat this.  I am a firm believer that food can be both healthy and delicious at the same time.  This may be healthy but it is not tasty which means to me that it is not worth eating.  Try the Hodgson Mills whole wheat macaroni and cheese instead.  It is so much better.	8	3

1	B004067J7C	AQBJF520TMK0B	Highly recommended	This mix is easy to prepare and very tasty. The only prep work consists of cutting up a zucchini which takes less than a minute. The seasoning is excellent, very flavorful but not too spicy. Sometimes low-salt mixes are spiced up with a lot of pepper but not this one. Excellent for vegetarians.	0	0
1	B004AH0MLG	A2QCEORN957RIP	Excellent gift.	I bought this for my husband on valentines day. he absolutely loved it! Took him a month to finish the whole thing. Great gift for a loved one, or a gag gift at christmas. I recomend to everyone.	1	0
1	B005K4Q1VI	A1YU3SAW0XHQIY	Surprisingly Good.	Truthfully, I wasn't expecting too much with this, but thought I would give it a try for something different for my Keurig. I have to say, that I was pleasantly surprised at how good this is.  My favorite is the dark chocolate, but the peppermint is very good as well.  I am not a real milk chocolate fan, but I mixed it with some coffee for a mocha and it was very good. I would definitely purchase this again.	4	0
1	B008FHUDW0	AVI6809ANU49D	K-cups	These k-cups were good. It was the delivery charge that I was upset with. Order a large amount to be delivered ASAP and didn't get them on time. I will not order from this site again. Was told by Amazon that they would reemburse me for the delivery charge and I was never compensated. I'll order from another site.	0	0

1	B006UQUAQC	A2SIK32WAX5FVE	LOVIN these wraps !!	If you looking for a healthier ( in my opinion anyway : )  alternative to the white rice wraps, you've found it here in these wraps !  I've been making raw wraps like they're going out of style since I got them, and enjoy them for lunches AND dinners several times a week !  You can stuff just about anything that floats your boat inside !  I just placed my second order, and now I can't imagine how I ever got along with out them.  If you're a Veg head..or not..and just want something easy,  AND fun to make, where you can use your creativity to make wraps a hundred different ways..well, maybe not 100, that are yummy, low cal, and nutritious..look no further !!!  Give these a try, you won't be disappointed : ))	1	0

1	B003EML8PM	A1IYWR1OOK6NK4	Lowrey's microwave pork rinds	Wal-mart used to carry these Lowrey's microwave pork rinds in a 4 pack, but as everybody knows just because it on wal-marts shelf today does not mean it will be there tomorrow. Well they discontinued carring them and I was BUMMED OUT beyond belief. I LOVE THESE THINGS. I done a search on line and found then on amazon.com and you can't imagine how happy I was. I bought 2 cases of them. My whole family is addicted to them. Did i mention I LOVE THESE THINGS. They go into my microwave for 1 minute and 20 seconds and you have hot fresh pork rinds. They are so much better than the pork rinds in the bag on the potato chip isle. 2 Thumbs Up	1	0

1	B000LKZL76	A2KMIV3LX5MLO5	Fantastic!	I saw this tea from my friend's room and asked for a couple. She has the Super Slimming tea and the Detox tea. I usually combine the two. It made me go to the bathroom more frequently than usual, but I feel much relieved like more refreshed. My pimples went away and my back acne is non-existent. The store in my area stopped selling this kind of brand, sucks! I have to purchased it on-line now.	3	2

-1	B002C50X1M	A1DTQYJG91K12I	Too many rotten chips!	I love salt & vinegar kettle chips so I decided to try these after reading good reviews. When I received them, I noticed from the very first bag that over half of the chips were inedible due to rotten potatoes! I know how kettle chips should look, and I know what normal marks look like on chips. These were rotten. After waiting over a month for a response from the company, I finally found a phone number and called them, only to be told there was nothing they could do. The sad thing is, the chips that were edible were actually flavorful and tasty. Obviously they just don't care about consistent quality, so stay away from these chips!	0	1
1	B000G6RYNE	ACYR6O588USK	Delicious Extra Crunchy	These potato chips are excellent.There are no trans fats.<br /><br />They taste absolutely delicious.Whenever I am in the mood for potatoe chips, Kettles is the brand I buy.<br /><br />A great product that anyone should enjoy and I highly recommend them!<br /><br />Enjoy!	14	3

1	B0000AH3QW	A1MC6BFHWY6WC3	THIS STUFF WORKS FOR US AND OUR DOGS LOVE IT - PERHAPS IT WILL WORK FOR YOU AND YOURS.	"Buying pet food can and is a tricky proposition.  This review is about dog food, Purina One, Smartblend, to be specific.  You can spend hours; no, days actually, researching various dog foods on line and via various publications.  Name a brand and you will find many who will defend it right down to the matt.  On the other hand, the same brand will have its distracters; folks who absolutely hate the stuff.  If you care about your dog (and you really should not have a dog if you don't care about it or them), then you need to do your research and do what you feel is best for your animal.  Now let me make one statement before I write the review...it is a rather important statement:<br /><br />If you dog gets sick on any given dog food, then for goodness sakes throw the stuff out, stop feeding your dog that food, and try something different!<br /><br />We have, at this time, four dogs.  They range from 9 pounds to 35 pounds and from two years old to 14 years old.  My wife and I have had dogs all of our lives; cats too, but we are primarily dog people.  We have been using Purina products for years and have been quite happy with the results.  We have healthy dogs and we go to great lengths to keep them that way.<br /><br />At present, and for the past four or five years, we have been using Purina ONE, Smartblend - Lamb & Rice Formula.  We have had great results with it.  There has been no weigh loss nor any weight gains - as long as we keep them on this stuff.  The only problems we do have is that our dogs absolutely LOVE people food and they are garbage guts when it comes to finding delicious ""things"" in the yard and in the woods.  People food and ""things"" usually bring on a case of diarrhea or in some cases, vomiting.  We take care that this does not happen but quite often we find the dogs are much smarter than we are and they are all four most certainly skilled beggars.<br /><br />Purina, as far as I can find, is manufactured here in the U.S.  Yes, they are owned by the Swiss company Nestle, but it would seem that the food is made here in the U.S.  Someone correct me if I am wrong please.<br /><br />If you compare the stuff in this food with that of other brands, it stacks up quite well.  All of our dogs prefer this food over other brands we have tried from time to time (more about that later), of course it must be remembered that all four are quite happy with four day old road killed possum - if they can get it.  The lamb seems to have a more soothing effect on them and they do not seem to have the problems digesting it as they do other meat additives.  Now don't get me wrong, they would prefer that we served them baked chicken (their absolute most favored food on earth) each day, but that ain't a going to happen!<br /><br />It should be noted that any time you change dog food brands or dog food mixes, you are going to have some digestive problems with your dogs.  It will almost always cause diarrhea or loose stools.  If you must change brands or contents, do it slowly, mixing the new brand with the old gradually over several days.  This is a pain, but it is worth it.<br /><br />We buy this stuff in the 18 pound bags here locally and the price is a bit higher, per pound, than we find here on Amazon...although that varies from month to month. If you have Amazon Prime then the shipping is not a factor to fret about.<br /><br />Overall, we are happy with this food and will be unless we learn differently or if our dogs start doing poorly. There are other dog foods of equal quality out there and the challenge is to find one that suits your particular dog's needs. This stuff does the job for us.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarks"	5	0

1	B006N3IG4K	A336QIZU3I4C3Z	A pleasing cup of coffee	"I found the taste and strength of this coffee just right for it to gain the honor of one of my ""go-to"" coffees for my Keurig.  Not too strong or bitter, I rather enjoy the flavor.  Sadly with the recent ""K-cup coup"" staged by Green Mountain Coffees, it looks like Amazon isn't carrying the Wolfgang Puck coffees any longer and my Subscribe and Save (and my business) will need to go elsewhere.  Definitely give this coffee a shot if you can."	1	1
1	B001E5E0IS	A3I3QSJ37U80L7	I found Unsmoked mate!	Ive enjoyed the traditional mates, and was recently looking for unsmoked mate that does not contain the Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (carcenogens) found in most mates that are smoke dried rather than air dried like this mate is.<br />that may be linked to mouth and lung cancers.  Ive heard drinking a strong cup of traditional mate is equal to smoking 3 cigarettes, or was it 3 packs?  I know that if i drink more than 1 cup I get sores in my mouth.<br /><br />It doesnt taste as strong as smoked mate- I got used to the rich smokey taste of that and was a bit let down by the taste of this, but its still an excellent high quality mate, pure leaf with no powder or stems, and I enjoy it more now knowing that its much healthier for me.<br /><br />Thank you eco teas!	6	0
1	B000B8FZOW	A30GK8MEM29S1O	Great Deal	This is the favorite treat of my dogs, I had been buying them one at a time at Planet Dog, buying this 25  pack saves me more than half what I was paying, and seems to be a better product than those I bought at Planet Dog.

1	B000F0BXCO	ANQ2B5I0OFB1E	Love these!	I've recently been diagnosed with celiac disease, which was horrible for an Italian food lover like me. But these g-f penne noodles are wonderful! They're bland on their own, but with some mushrooms, Parmesan cheese, a little seasoning and a good sauce, they taste as perfect as anything I ever got at an Italian restaurant. De Boles gluten free products have played a huge role in how easily I've been able to give up my favorite wheat-y foods and acquire a taste for their gluten-free substitutions. These noodles took me a few tries to become accustomed to, and playing around a bit to get the right sauce and seasoning, but now I absolutely love them! SO happy to have these!	0	0
1	B0018AGPKU	A3F1KG4OXQP5UX	Best flavor	You cannot seem to find the little rolls of life savers around anymore.  Or if stores do carry the rolls, they only carry one or two flavors.  Wintergreen is good but spearmint is my absolute favorite!  The candy came fresh and unbroken.  Easiest way to keep up my life saver supply.	0	1
1	B0013NUGDE	AJT8SZ11T4EYP	These are the best chips ever	I absolutely love these chips.  All the flavors are great, but my favorites are Plain, Cheddar and Sour Cream & Onion.  I started eating them when I was trying to lose weight, and now that I lost the weight, I continue to eat them because the taste so great -- much better than greasy potato chips and more flavorful than baked chips.<br />I love the portion control size. Keep up the great work PopChips!!!!	0	0
-1	B002JWZVWO	A1KIT78G85X3WH	The worst coconut water I've ever tasted	I have tried many brands of coconut water, including some flavored ones, but this one does not merit even one star.  It does not taste at all like coconut water --- WAY too much sugar and flavorings added --- sickeningly sweet. Very disappointing and truly a waste of my money.  Same was true of the passionfruit flavor. Yuck.	4	3

-1	B0085G4ACA	A2PBF8V7UDJ5CP	Not the greatest.	This product doesn't have the greatest taste. I like Jamba coconut water, but it's hard product to find. I purchased this to try out and I'm not liking it, but it's tolerable when it's cold; really cold (reason why I gave it two stars).  I tried the coconut water when it was warm to see if it really tastes bad like some of the reviews said and sure enough, they were right.	0	0

1	B00389Q4XW	AIM09S38IAY87	Good Cocoa	Very tasty.  You do need to remove the top and scrape out the remaining cocoa to really get all of the flavor.  This is what we have had to do with every brand of cocoa we have bought.  The flavor is excellent.	4	0
1	B005HB4HGU	AREJXK815FD5T	Great for cooking and baths	Great salt! Though now that I know how great it is I will have to buy a bigger bag next time.

1	B003VXFK44	A3502W435NLGAZ	Nice French roast	I've tried every single French roast K-cup, and this is one of my favorites.

1	B000EH2QP6	A1XGFW5016CGQI	YOUR DOGS WILL LOVE THIS FOOD! IMPRESSIVE INGREDIENTS	My 11 dogs love this so I say it is great! The tiny ones (toy poodles) get the almost straight food. The others get this mixed with their Bil-Jac. I am impressed with the ingredients. Not full of corn! Another thing I noticed... Every time I have fed my dogs any brand of straight canned dog food, with the exception of Science Diet, they had diarrhea. Not with this one. Not even one of them had it. That's a good thing. I ordered two more cases and will continue. The price is reasonable too and free shipping with Amazon Prime or free shipping with purchase over 25.00. I also ordered the chicken with rice and the dog food for all life stages.  My dogs love them all the same. I had never purchased food with lamb in it before but the one for life stages has it. i do not like the way veal or lamb are treated and have never eaten it myself either. However,having said that, I will be ordering this monthly for my dogs. Just wish there were more choices without lamb. It is impressive that their cattle are free range grazing cattle and fish are ocean not farm raised. I believe my dogs are eating better than us! Seriously, you will be impressed with the ingredients list on these foods.	5	0
-1	B006WJHOX4	A2N7V6NY8ZXGMA	Not as fresh dated as I get at the Stores and made in Mexico	"I just received 3 Boxes of Kellogs Rasin Bran as a Subscribe and Save purchase.  I like to check the ""Use By Date"" at the stores because it may sit awhile in our pantry before we use it.  I bought Kellogs Rasin Bran at Sam's Club last week, and it has a date for June 2013.  The boxes I just got from Amazon are dated for February 2013, so I will have to use them up first.  It is mid-Sept 2012 now, so there is still time to use the 3 boxes.  But dissapointed that they are closer dated than at the stores here. Also, the Box from Sam's shows Battle Creek, Michigan - and these from Amazon show being from Mexico. Based on this and other reviews here mentioning Kellog's ingredients being altered, I think I will change to another brand and cancel my Subscribe and Save."	1	0

1	B001IZM8A6	A2ANZVA56T7RAG	Great product	I ordered this product at the same time as the Kirkland Signature salmon.  The Raincoast Trading Co. salmon is very tasty, equally as good quality salmon as the Kirkland.  However, the Raincoast arrived in perfect condition, the Kirkland cans were dented badly.  I recommend this product to anyone who likes boneless skinless canned salmon.	0	0

-1	B0048IDNLI	A6ZMZRIXD7MNE	Nutricity is the VERY WORST EVER place to order from	Nutricity is the very worst ever place to order. I ordered almond butter thinking it came in a glass bottle and when I received it it was packages in plastic. I returned them and they send me an email saying they did not receive returns. When I tried to get in touch with them with their 800 number a recording said they only handle returns via email. I will never ever order from them. I highly recommend that nobody ever orders from them. When I ordered I never read that you couldn't return an item. And then to top it off I could not talk to anyone in their company they handle all via email. VERY DISSAPOINTING! DO NOT ORDER ANYTHING FROM THEM.	3	3
1	B000E1DSJU	A2PKM6BZPO2I9P	The Best Marinade	I have tried several marinades over the years and this is hands down the best I have found. My favorite is to use this one on boneless pork ribs, marinade overnite for a stonger flavor, but 30 minutes does a great job also.	1	0

1	B001PO7FIU	A1H4NF2OI9P8P7	A flavorful alternative to extra virgin olive oil for high temperature cooking	I bought Avocado Oil specifically for two reasons: one, because it is very similar to olive oil in texture and smell, yet brings a new flavor component to my cooking, and secondly and most importantly for me . . . it has a much higher smoke/burn point than extra virgin olive oil--even higher than Canola oil, grapeseed oil and yes, even safflower oil. I've also read that it's just as healthy. The smoke point of avocado oil is somewhere north of 500F! Roughly 520F in fact. That's amazing, and gives me the versatility I need to quick-fire or sear virtually anything under high heat. La Tourangelle's Avocado Oil, one of the few I've tried, tastes great! Fresh and subtly aromatic.<br /><br />Basically, this has been the cure to my burned olive oil blues. That's an especially nice thing, since I have a hyper-sensitive smoke detector and have little room for error when it comes to smoke. To sum it up, though I don't always cook with it (I still use olive oil for low and medium temperature cooking), I love having avocado oil close at hand, for those times when I need it. It actually won't replace your olive oil though, because it has a somewhat different flavor, but it is a flavor I love. Avocado oil is ingenious (and a somewhat new discovery), and La Tourangelle is a trusted producer of the finest of fine edible oils. I trust their brand for some other less well-known oils as well.<br /><br />Highly and enthusiastically recommended--to the point that I'm trying to persuade my family and friends to start cooking with Avocado oil.	83	1
-1	B0030VBRIU	A1PZ9580938SVM	Bring back the old formula!!	Was so disappointed to discover that HappyBaby changed Super Salmon!  My little girl LOVED the old formula, and it had more protein and calories than this new version.  The new version also has more sugar and sodium than the previous version, and it has a completely different taste and texture - she won't touch it.  We will not be buying it again.	1	0

1	B003TIVBSU	A241MJV79A4J5O	Love these!!	I've ordered these before and I am still thrilled with the product.  They are fresh, soft and very fragrant.  I use a lot of vanilla bean because my family loves vanilla sauce and baked goods made with the fresh bean.  You must seal these very tightly to keep them soft (I use the seal-a-meal), but with care, they will stay nice for months and you can't beat the price!  McCormick sells vanilla beans in a jar and you get two or three beans for anywhere up to $6! And the quality isn't anywhere near what these are.  I will continue to buy this product.	0	0

1	B000H2405M	ADAE39MJ3JA9E	Dang Good Eating	We've been eating this for years. In fact since before they changed the name. It was originally named with a three letter word (similar to darn) that Amazon won't let me write. We've tried quite a number of variations of this and it always turns out good. Sausage works well. Add cream cheese, sour cream, cheddar cheese, or bacon when serving. We only buy from Amazon as they have the best pricing so sometimes we have to wait for stock but it's worth the wait.

So I ordered a pack and he really did not seem interested.  Mango juice works great for constipation if your kids like the taste.	0	0

1	B0001LVX4K	A1Q7UL05NV89PF	Branston Pickle (Relish)	Since I discovered this wonderful relish in England a few years ago I have tried to buy replacements in this country. It is served at most pubs in the UK as part of a Ploughman's Lunch along with various cheeses and other goodies. It has a wonderful taste and texture, unlike anything in this country. I recommend every one buy some. I've found it only on Amazon.	6	0
1	B007M83302	A1UASXJKH475MV	As far as diet foods go, it's definitely 5 star!	We received a sampler package from Amazon that had several flavors....cheddar, bbq, sour cream/onion, plain, salt and pepper, and also the salt and vinegar.<br /><br />I've already received our first shipment of just the vinegar version.  These are a good salty fix without the calories...and each proportioned pouch is satisfying in one sitting.  I would've liked to try the garlic parm but it wasn't included.<br /><br />Our #1 is salt and vinegar and #2 would probably be the salt and pepper.	0	0
-1	B0042RNHVG	A2N3KKZAWOQU19	Stale	I've purchased the Golden Malted Natural Pancake and Waffle flour in the past and was excited to see the Blueberry on Amazon.  I received the mixes yesterday and am very disappointed. It  has little flavor and waffles are not as light as the regular mix, possibly due to the expiration date being 2 weeks from today.	0	0
-1	B000M5PP8U	ABAPF3XY1W6JX	Wholly underwhelming	I am not happy about writing this review. I had very high expectations from both the name and the high praise given by the other reviewers. I was at once concerned, however, based on the weak aroma at first opening. And, these initial concerns were confirmed at first use... little flavor here. I have found a home recipe based off of the ingredient list with stuff from my spice rack produces a much better result.<br /><br />Beef Rub: Brown sugar, sea salt, paprika, chille, rosemary, fresh garlic, chipotle powder, cumin, and McCormick Montreal Steak Seasoning.<br /><br />Chicken Rub: Brown sugar, paprika, sea salt, chille, McCormick Montreal Chicken Seasoning, curry, garlic, cinnamon, and Chinese Five Spices.	0	0
1	B0058AMY74	A27C44BIRQH3QW	The Best Chips...PERIOD!	You don't need salt to hide the taste of potato chips. And these chips prove it. The taste of the potato comes through, instead of being masked. OK, so they're still a snack food, but no salt and no trans-fats mean these are about the healthiest potato chips you can get. And if you're on a low-salt diet (like I am), having these available means I can eat chips, and Kettle are just the best.	13	2

1	B004M0ES98	A3DADP1572NER3	full of flavor!	These are the best-tasting green splits I've ever had.  I love creamy soups, split pea being one of my favorites, but it's not usually easy to make a delicious creamy soup without adding some sort of meat flavoring (I don't eat anything that used to have a face). These peas are delicious without having been cooked with any sort of meat/chicken-based flavorings.  Nice and fresh-no more of those gray colored little things sold in plastic bags at the grocery store. These peas even smell fresh in the bag (which is a nice drawstring muslin).	0	0

1	B00126IBFC	A27R54YTZUWWBC	Great for the holidays	We ordered this with a gift card, and it arrived right in time for the holidays. We really liked the smoked turkey breast, and it made the best sandwiches I have had for quite awhile.  The ham was OK, nothing to shout about, but it was good. I thought that the meat was coming boneless, but that was a blessing because the ham bone made for some excellent bean soup after all the meat was consumed. I would order again. One big plus was the speed of filling the order, and the rapid delivery. It was originally stated that when shipped it would have a window of 8 days to be delivered. it was delivered 4 days after I ordered it.  I was impressed, and so was the Wife.	0	0
-1	B000VHJPKI	A2XJV8WWLH4XX	Terrible	Yup it's calorie free and carb free and boy can you tell!!  I tried this twice, wanted to really like it but it was horrible.  I threw it out.  I guess if you want BBQ sauce that's really going to taste good, you'll have to take the calories and carbs.  It's too bad, but this stuff was awful.  Wasted my money.	3	0
1	B009HINRX8	ADDBLG0CFY9AI	Best of the Tassimo's	We've tried many Tassimo flavors.  This is by far our favorite.  Our normal cup of coffee is Starbuck's house blend out of a Cuisinart pot but one or two days a week we use our Tassimo.  This coffee is rich but not too stong.  I don't understand the current price over $20 for 14 disks and hope that it will be lowered on Amazon.  For now, we'll buy elsewhere.	1	0
-1	B004N66R6I	A1CSR6PDGHT8AP	Beware	In February 2012, I bought these treats while traveling for my 10lbs dog.  I chose them because they seemed fairly healthy, and all of the ingredients were something easily recognizable.  After a week of giving him these (following the feeding instructions), he got violently ill.  He went outside to potty and collapsed on the deck on the way back into the house.  He deficated while lying on his side.  I called him to me, he got up and slowly made his way to me before falling over again.  When I picked him up, his head was lolling from side to side and he couldn't keep his eyes open.  I went to grab my shoes and purse while my mom looked up the closest emergency vet.  That's when he began vomiting.<br /><br />By the time we were seen at the vet hospital, his vitals were retuning to normal.  I explained what had happened and they said he'd probably had a seizure.  After checking him out, they said that he seemed fine, but asked what he'd been eating, was it possible that he'd gotten into a pesticide, etc.  At the time, I couldn't think of anything.  When we retuned from our trip, I took him to our regular vet and they did a work up on him.  They didn't find anything.  A couple of weeks later I was watching the news, and when they mentioned that the next story was about dog treats making pets sick, I knew.  I didn't immediately remember the brand name, but after looking up the type and look of the package, I knew it was Canyon Creek Ranch Chicken Yam Good.  To confirm, I called my mom and made her pull out the package.  I was right.  These treats we're the ONLY thing different in his diet.<br /><br />I am thankful that he only had an acute attack from these and not something chronic or worse.  I am going to write a letter to the Neslte pet division, to their CEO, CFO, board of directors, anyone, to let them know that they are making pets sick and worse.  They should be ashamed of themselves	1	0
1	B008ZRKZSM	A1NK3AP0NLZH1N	Actually Very Good	Wasn't sure if I would like this product but it's very good. Taste good, consistency is great. Very glad I tried it, I will order more.	1	1
-1	B001E4Q5WI	A2RKP4J5JDUSPG	Not worth it...	"I bought this by accident, then decided to give it a chance.  Not worth it, I would rather have less real peanut butter than eat this.  It has a gritty consistency because of the sugar and tastes too sweet and not ""pea-nutty"". It was more sugary sweet than tasting like peanut butter and the gritty texture just turned me off, maybe because it was creamy?<br />I would like to find a PB with less fat but still enjoy it, this was not it for me."	3	2
1	B00141UC9I	A2A82G59GRC8A	FAVORITE TREAT	By far my dogs favorite treat, it is also very healthy.  My crazy friend decide to taste it, he said it was excellent, a chicken jerky with less fat and preservatives.	1	0

1	B007M83302	A3SMV35531YME	Yummy!	These are a nice, light alternative to ordinary potato chips. To me, they have a sort of buttery flavor. They're crunchy, a little sweet, and not the least bit greasy. My husband took some to work and they were a huge hit with his coworkers. In fact, he had none left for himself!	0	2
-1	B003OB0IB8	A2DLRG3YX6A2ZU	Not for me	I must be a bit of a wuss, because this soup tastes to me how I imagine fire might taste. Typically I like spicy food if it has a good flavor.  I don't find this to be the case with this soup. Any flavor is killed off by the burn.	2	1
1	B004538TME	A3VNUEWUVEYQ8F	All these other brands and the name we know and trust is the best	I have tried several of the K-cups and none of them have the taste that Folgers has. They are either too strong, too bitter or just have a funny taste. Not that they all taste bad, just not what I have been looking for. I just want some good old fashion American tasting coffee and this is it. If you want coffee that is comparable to MacDonald coffee this is the closest I have found in the K-cup.	1	0
1	B006N3IG4K	A1RVCWFP3SC3GU	YUMMY	We always drink Timmothy's or Emeril's. Thought we would try something different. Not too many decafs to choose from.

1	B001ELLB4S	A3VKBFC5K2INR4	awesome	I was a little scared to get a whole tub of these because i had previously gotten the hemp sample pack, with one of the single serve packets of this in it. But i figured it would be worth having around as a quick meal on the go. I was right. I put the recommended four tablespoons in, a little water, some soy milk, a banana and ice and blend away. It is not super sweet or too grainy. I like that it has a lot of fiber and the chocolate taste is noticably delicious. I plan on making this a monthly buy.	1	0
1	B001EQ5EJQ	A17NAY0SGPJZX4	Ooooh-la-la	I almost can't put into words how much I love this product - the packaging, the flavor, the health benefits, the price (especially with the subscription discount) - fabulous!  The vinaigrette recipe on the can is phenomenal - I mix up a couple of cups of it and keep it in a squeeze bottle in the fridge, use it on greens, antipasto, and grilled chicken.  I use the oil straight for the finishing touch on a lot of items.  Recently I found myself with a last-minute invitation to dinner and not a lot of ingredients in the house to throw together a contribution - settled on a white bean bruscetta with a drizzle of this oil, and people swooned.  It elevates everything it touches.	3	0

Even my 3 month old black lab puppy goes running to his kennel when I tell him to go to bed because he knows that a liver treat is coming his way. Since they are sliced small a large container of these will last a while. The only complaint I have is that my dog loves these so much that if she knows shes getting one she starts to drool, and she's not a drooler... So I gotta toss one to her quick!!	0	0

-1	B002RBTV78	A1JFMK13YIEFE4	Lindor Truffles	"I ordered two-60 count boxes for the candy table at my daughter's wedding, knowing that these would be the ultimate! When we opened the box, the truffles were puckered, and chocolate was inside of the ends of the wrappers.  Some so badly (about 27-28), that I could not put them into the candy jar to take to the venue. The rest were still puckered with indentations on them. But I tried to pick the least worst ones. I opened some up to see how they taste because of the bad quality of them, in wrapped form. They did taste amazing as usual. What an embarrassment at a $30,000 plus venue. I sent an email to Sue""s Shirt Shop and More (seller through Amazon). They informed me that they were perfect at time of shipment, but wanted the order number. On October 3, I provided them the info and told them they were by far not perfect when received, that I did not have them in any heat (that I was home at time of delivery) and wondered how could they tell me they were in perfect condition at time of shipment unless they themselves physically inspected each one. As of this date, I have not heard back. I do know that we paid $10.98 for shipping and handling and would think that USPS was not responsible for their condition; however, only Amazon.com would know that. The issue of shipping never came up. But in the end, the customer (us) got the shaft. For the price we paid, we could have bought each piece individually in a local shop. Unfortunately, we did not know this would happen. I would never order these again, online. We did it because it was the only way to buy boxes of them.  omg, I have now first read other reviews and find that ours, too, did not have the shiny, crisp covering that they normally have. And, yes, there were chocolate stains on the inside of the box they came in. Just like in other orders. I now see that I am not alone in having the problems of quality being far under par. I just wish mine would have been of the correct quality so that it didn't leave a bad impression on the candy table at our daughter's wedding, which was otherwise elegant. Then again, hopefully, it reflected on the quality of Lindor truffles themselves. All I know is that someone should be very concerned. I feel like these were the rejects of their product. And, they probably were..."	0	0

-1	B000633WEW	AMQ1MEG334SAP	A Big Ripoff!	"I bought this thing after a recommendation from a pet store rep. My dog hardly touched the stuff, and then I looked at the ingredients: one of the first things on it was corn-a grain known to cause allergies in dogs. As a matter of fact, corn might be the most allergy-prone food amongst dogs. Not to mention, thanks to our friends at Monsanto, it is almost always Genetically modified (GMO) or a franken-food, unless it's organic. Real ""premium"" dog foods brag that they've no corn.<br /><br />Right at the top of the list of ingredients is chicken-by-products, another no-no among real ""premium"" dog foods. This means all the waste that it is usually thrown out from the chicken since it's not real meat. Cheap dog foods put this in their food simply because it's cheap, but it's not real meat. A little further down you will notice BHA, an artificial preservative, which again real ""premium"" dog foods do not have.<br /><br />In short, BilJac is a joke. It is basically, insanely overpriced Alpo, with no organic ingredients whatsoever, and uses all the shortcuts, filler, and chemistry that the cheapest dog foods on the market use. Don't be fooled by the old-fashioned appeal of the company's 60 years in business. There is nothing but modern chemistry in the bag, and all the folksy appeal will not make up for cheap, lousy ingredients. Calling this stuff premium dog food would be like calling a Kia a Mercedes. For nearly the same price as this overpriced Alpo, one could buy organic dog food, free of preservatives, corn, and cheap by-products!"	0	0

The mix makes a dense loaf that can be enhanced with the addition of molasses and sesame seeds, or with the addition of herbs such as dill, oregano or basil.  I've added other herbs and spices, as well as parmesan cheese, and the bread always turns out fantastic.  The mix also makes great sandwich buns.  I highly recommend this product.	0	0
-1	B0002ML8D4	A2IYLMDQGBB4VG	didn't work for my dogs	Wee bits is a great size kibble for small dogs. However, soft stools were the results with my two little dogs. I added lactobacillus/acidophilus but it made no difference. I called the local distributor in our state, and his recommendation was adding yogurt or lactobacillus...some dog foods just don't work for certain dogs, and I don't think you should have to add supplements just so your dog can tolerate the diet. We have since switched to Innova EVO and have great results.	2	0
-1	B002YH5JJ4	A1MNQYPJ2BCC05	No more like lemon zest than wood shavings	This product is NOT lemon zest.  Bears no resemblance to lemon zest - does not look like lemon zest, does not smell like lemon zest, nor does it taste like lemon zest.  In fact the label says 'Contains granules of dehydrated lemon peel'.  The picture of lush, juicy lemons is hugely misleading and if I was able to give this product no stars, I would.  I thought I would give it a try, but the consistency of the rehydrated whatever it is was mushy, tasteless and without smell.  I did not risk putting it in my ginger cookies and had to make a quick trip to the store to get some real lemons.  Don't waste your money as I did.	2	0

They're obviously addicted to the stuff - a very unhealthy habit.<br /><br />I can't drink soda pop myself, it's been 5 years or so since I had one, and so I began searching for a drink that tasted like regular soda pop, but wasn't unhealthy.  I searched high and low for a suitable alternative - and then I found  Izze.<br /><br />I love the fruity, tangy flavor of Izze's sparkling grafefruit soda.  The grapefruit flavor goes well with spicy mexican foods, but it is also great just by itself.<br /><br />My teens love Izze and drink it now just like soda pop!  I'm so happy to know they aren't guzzling down corn syrup and artificial colors and flavors, but instead are enjoying all-natural Izze, with no added sweeetners!<br /><br />If you're looking for a great alternative to regular soda pop - you can't do better than to buy Izze.	5	0
-1	B003EML8PM	A3OLU8FL2S7L00	NOT EDIBLE - MSG - EXCESSIVE SALT	A warning should be placed on the item description because this product contains Monosodium Glutamate (MSG), a dangerous excitotoxin which is problematic for many people. There is no indication in the item description that this is the case. I fully agree with another reviewer that this item also is so extremely salty that it cannot be consumed. The MSG also heightens the very salty taste. This item did puff up very nicely in the microwave, but it was inedible because of the saltiness and all 18 packages had to be thrown out. For that reason, I am surprised at the many excellent reviews of this product. Amazon.com gets an A+++ for their wonderful handling of this problem.	0	1

Some people mispronounce the name and call it: Bonzai whuch means to kill. Bonsai (bone sigh) means 'to plant in a basin'. This the correct sound.

1	B001CGTN1I	AUBJ799D34OPD	healthy & fun food!	For health reasons, I try to eat highly nutritious low carb foods. I love tapioca but it's 100% carbs with no nutritional value. I was introduced to chia seeds and it is a highly nutritious low carb food but it is also a fun food. It absorbs 12x its weight in liquids and puffs up and reminds me of tapioca with a strawberry seed inside (and that's what it tastes/feels like). Another one of my favorites is the Mexican drink called: Chia fresca, which is basically soaked chia seeds in lemonade. You have to experience it yourself to know why it's so popular.  One lb. added to liquid will create 10-14# of highly nutritious food.<br /><br />Chia seeds (best known for the chia pet) are high in protein, 5x the calcium of milk and high in Omega 3 oils. Chia seeds are seeds of an herb and are grown in Mexico, south & central America and were the food of the Aztecs.<br /><br />I would think you could make faux tapioca pudding with just coconut milk, chia seeds & sweetener, but I don't know how well the chia would absorb the coconut milk since it's so fatty. (Can of coconut milk, 1/4 cup chia seeds & sweetener to taste) I make it with 2 cups of water, 4 scoops of whey protein, then I soak one cup of chia seeds in this and when it has plumped up, I add 2 cans of coconut milk and sweetener. Sometimes I cream a package of cream cheese into a can of pumpkin, cinnamon and add that for more nutrition for a pumpkin pie tapioca pudding.	82	2
1	B0015R9BQG	A35VJJW05NS0TH	Great taste and texture	"The teriyaki seitan strips have great smoky/sweet barbecue taste and a nice stringy, ""pulled"" texture. They're full of protein and 100 calories each (I wish it were even a little less), which makes for a great snack. They dont't taste like beef jerky, but it's not supposed to. They're isolated soy-free (there's a little soy from the soy sauce in it), as the base is vital wheat gluten. I carry one in my purse all the time just in case I get hungry."	1	0
1	B0038AXDQM	A1Z31WP1M6XWTQ	Great spice and flavor in the mouth, no burn in the belly!	I was introduced to this sauce by a coworker from Guatemala. I love all kinds of hot sauces, but this one is truly unique as it has a nice level of spice to it, has a good burn in the mouth, but does not carry the burn to your stomach. It, somehow, really enhances food flavor without taking over the natural flavor. You gotta try this stuff!!	0	0

1	B007M83302	ASIMCC20UVK58	Great Chips Less Fat	"I eat chips almost every day and decided I wanted to find something that tastes as good but is lighter on unnecessary fat than regular types of chips. I bought a case of Popchips BBQ. These are satisfying and taste great. They don't taste exactly like any full fat chip products I've had mainly because they're not greasy at all, but they have a nice BBQ potato chip flavor. These are thick, crunchy, and light. I first bought the .8 oz bags and this serving size is on the small side for me with lunch (would probably be alright for a snack). 3 of the .8 oz bags works for me which of course bumps up the fat intake, but considering the same volume of ""regular"" chips has much more fat it is a significant fat decrease overall which is what I was looking for. I find the 3 ounce bags to be perfect. Even eating all 3 ounces works out to significantly less fat and calories than eating the same volume of other chips. This makes Popchips very satisfying to me, and I have bought many cases through Amazon.<br /><br />Heads up (mid-2011): Unfortunately the price has gone up significantly for these chips through Amazon, causing me to cancel my subscribe & save subscriptions. Popchips have popped up in local stores for significantly less per ounce. I love the convenience of the portioned bags and subscription but it's hard to justify paying double for the same product.<br /><br />The flavors are pretty straight forward but here's my thoughts...<br />Original flavor: Tastes like a plain potato chip minus the grease. Not my favorite flavor, but good for what it is. This flavor would probably be good with some kind of dip.<br />Chedder: Cheddar quickly became tied with BBQ for my favorite. Like BBQ the cheddar flavor is very strong. Great chips.<br />Salt & Pepper: Very strong pepper. To enjoy these you have to really like pepper. I like them, but they're not a favorite.<br />Sea Salt & Vinegar: I'm not a fan of vinegar, but strangely I enjoy this flavor. They're indeed salty with a fairly strong vinegar flavor."	1	0
1	B006N3I84I	AMXEJKNQQHGPC	Super yum for dark coffee lovers	Purchased this after receiving a Tully's sampler in the mail. This brand hadn't been on my radar at all until then since we usually alternated Black Tiger or Jet Fuel. This is a new favorite and we will definitely purchase again!	0	0

Not to mention that anti-green waste of 3 smaller packages...it's more expensive than at the company store!!<br /><br />I think a lot of people buy these thinking they are getting 1 lb bags, which seem to be the standard.

It wasn't BAD ... it had a mildly coconutty (though not sweet) flavor, but it just wasn't anything special. It was rather bland, and I had a hard time finishing it as it started to warm up. Since I'm not a competitive athlete and don't have any great need to replenish my electrolytes, I'd rather just drink water.	1	1

1	B001BDDTB2	A146H4KN4LFR60	Cat Tested, Owner Approved	We have made friends recently with an abandoned tabby cat we call Mr. Whiskers. I am sure he would be grateful for most anything on a plate at this stage, still he appears to be a gentleman of discernment. And at first whiff of Petite Cuisine, he settled down to some serious feeding and joyously licked his whiskers afterwards.<br /><br />This is an obviously high end cat food and looks and smells good enough for humans. (Let us hope in this economy it does not come to that.) As long as I can afford it I will continue feeding him this brand. I have seen pets fed cheap food develop terrible tumors on their poor little bodies, so I am committed to serving him the best I can find / afford.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you care about your pet and can afford it I highly reccommend this brand. I was quite impressed by the quality.	0	0

1	B005HB4HGU	AC9JAT85740ME	super fast shipping, free samples	placed the order on tuesday, received it on saturday with the cheapest shipping; super faster. the himalayan salt comes in a sealed ziploc bag that has a bottom that allows it to sit up vertically which is convenient for storage especially if you have way too many spices and sacks of beans and sugars and what not like me. in addition, it came with 3 samples (himalayan salt, lemon citron flake salt, and cyprus white flake salt) weighing quite a few grams each (sorry, doesn't say the weight and i don't have a scale with me at the moment).<br /><br />as far as product quality goes, i typically buy my himalayan salt from whole foods and aesthetically this salt look exactly like the salt i get from whole foods. i haven't tasted it yet, but i bet it tastes like salt. of course price wise this salt (the spice lab) is WAY cheaper than buying himalayan salt at whole foods (even including shipping).	13	3

1	B0028GY93S	AA1JJNJ5VYI97	Love this food!	My main reason for purchasing this dog food was that I wanted a food made here in the U.S., of natural ingredients and not made in a plant where chemicals are processed.<br />Recently I have lost 2 of my beloved small animals to a company who produces pet foods in the same plant as chemicals, pesticides, and other cleaning agents. It is my belief that carelessness and greed led to contaminated small animal food that killed my 2 pets.<br /><br />I have a 65lb German Shepherd/Aussie mix with a leg injury, and joint problems. She has always been very active & full of energy for her age of 8 years old. In the past I've tried either making her food or searching out holistic foods that are made here in the U.S. with natural ingredients.<br /><br />We started out with a small bag of this food at first to see if she would eat it. Immediately she loved it! She had no stomach upset, even though her stomach is sensitive. Right away her coat started getting softer & shinier. There wasn't as much problems with her joints and leg injury as before and I did notice even more energy in her!<br /><br />Now that I've been feeding her this for a while her coat has continued to soften, looks shinier & no more scratching! She's maintained her regular weight without gaining any. Her energy level is amplified and she's showing very little discomfort in her joints & with her leg injury. What I love best is that she eats every last bite of this food when its feeding time, when before she would only pick at her food. I've fed her other brands of holistic, natural and organic foods and none of them were this much of a hit with her. This food really has made a difference in her overall health, coat and energy levels. None of the other foods made her coat this soft!<br /><br />These are bite sized pieces of food that an older or smaller dog would be able to eat. Mine doesn't like big chunks of food, she prefers the smaller bites so this one is perfect for her. Oh, and upon opening this bag the scent is like meat not bread or preservatives in other foods. This food isn't greasy either like many of the others we've tried in the past that leave stains on the floor if it drops and she misses a piece.<br /><br />I'd definitely recommend this food to everyone who has a small or large dog. The differences you will notice right away in your dog will make you a believer in this food as well!	9	0

1	B003VXFK44	A38NL22J79JOH1	Favorite K-Cup	Of all the K-Cups I have purchased so far, I like this French Roast the best. It has a really bold taste even used with the large-cup button. I like other coffee selections too, but this one really stands out.<br /><br />I consider myself an early adapter and the Keurig coffee machine is one of my best purchases. Although the coffee is somewhat expensive at $.40-.50 a cup, there is no waste, no pot cleanup, and, best of all, great coffee. I usually get up earlier than the rest of the household and can have my great coffee almost instantly without making a full pot that can go sour before all being drank.<br /><br />I notice that regular retailers such as Target and grocery stores are now carrying K-Cups, but buying online costs less and is more convenient. pjs	5	0
1	B003VXFK44	AWU8B9JFO1BIE	My favorite hazelnut k-cup!	I love this brand!  The best hazelnut flavor ever! I wait for it to go on sale because it is more expensive than the other brands.  Also, as another reviewer noted, it does say decaff on the bottom of the package! It really should state that in the product description. I've noticed the packages from Bed, Bath and Beyond did not state this but can't imagine both are available.  I'll still purchase it because the flavor is so smooth.	0	0
1	B004KPFUCO	A2PYWHBRRN15DS	Just like sugar	Tastes just like white sugar, but sounds like it's healthier. It tends to clump up in the bag more than sugar does, but that's not really an issue.	2	0

-1	B003EML8PM	A2W5H8M2HDOJMS	Unbearably salty	For starters, I'm not salt or msg averse. I enjoy salty food like chips, jerky, and bacon. However, these pork rinds are ridiculously salty tasting. To give you a better idea of what I'm referring to, Kettle Chips Sea Salt variety have 55 mg of salt per 1/2 oz of chips. Lowrey's pork rinds have 310 mg of sodium per 1/2 oz serving. That's roughly six times the salt content of a food considered relatively salty by most people. I read a review on here saying that they were too salty and decided to order them anyway thinking the reviewer was some salt hating baby. Boy, was I mistaken. I wish I hadn't ordered these.	2	1

It's got a fiery, bold flavor, like the volcanoes of Indonesia. Starbucks' Komodo blend is equally kicky. The Sumatra Coffee is delicious, spicy, piquant... one of Starbucks best. It's stronger than <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ546Y"">Starbucks Breakfast Blend Coffee, Ground, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 3)</a> It's a perfect accompaniment to spicy huevos rancheros, and it's great on its own.

Her moves are more fluid now, without the 'stiff' look to her stride because of the glucosamine and chondroitin contained in this product. Plus she looks forward to getting the treats every day (her favorite is the Duck Breast).<br />I also give my dog a Best Pet Health chewable tablet every evening that contains glucosamine, chondroitin, and MSM.

1	B0016JJEFG	A2A1XYSB692L6J	T E A......F I T......F O R.....A.....K I N G....{  : )	"As a ""royal-watcher"" since childhood, I did a double-take and stopped short, walking back to where I had been, when I saw this in my periferal vision, several years ago, in the supermarket.  It was that CROWN and that ROBE that Mr. Newman was wearing that got my eye.<br /><br />""Royal Tea"" from Paul Newman's enterprises!  Why not?  I mean -- who deserved to name his tea ""Royal Tea"" than this superstar whose charitable heart was as good as his acting skills, and as wonderful as his ever-handsome looks?  The maverick in me has always liked the slightly-cocky half-smile Mr. Newman gave so often on the screen.  It was as if he had a touch -- just a touch, mind you -- of anger at our ""esteemed"" leadership, and at authority in general....just as I have?  Probably....<br /><br />Anyway, I bought the tea, and found it's flavour really good.  Tasty tea -- thy name is NEWMAN'S OWN ORGANICS ROYAL TEA, ORGANIC BLACK TEA, 100 INDIVIDUALLY WRAPPED TEA BAGS, 7.05-OUNCE BOXES, (PACK OF 6).  It has a light, but very bold flavour.  And a very good flavour, too!<br /><br />I have recently found I must cut down on my favourite sweetener, SPLENDA. (TOO much of anything isn't good -- and too much SPLENDA, at least in my case, was beginning to affect my liver!)  I've partially solved this problem by putting TWO tea-bags in a slightly larger cup, (actually a 22-ounce glass), and this allows me to cut down on my Splenda packets.  It also gives the tea a more robust taste.<br /><br />The message on the back of the box, from Mr. Newman's daughter, Nell, (who appears with him in Royal roobes on the front), is funny, and a priceless view into the mind and heart of the sadly late Mr. Newman.  Who knows, but that he, (and Nell), may very well have had royal ancestors?  He was certainly handsome enough, (and Nell quite beautiful enough), to have this actually be true.  The message is delightful, and I am so glad it has been continued on the box.  (One note to Nell, thoough: a ""perilous"" person is one who is usually a villain(ess).  I take it that you are NOT ""perilous"", but ""imperilled"", (someone who IN danger.)  Please check<br />with the dictionary to be sure I am right on this!<br /><br />I've been fortunate enough to be able to sample the English FORTUM & MASON's ""Royal Blend Tea"".  It is very tasty, too -- but also imported, and thus,<br />very expensive.  NEWMAN'S OWN ORGANICS ROYAL TEA, ORGANIC BLACK TEA, is really tasty, less expensive, and truly an AMERICAN tea.  It proves, in a totally American way, that one need not be a king or queen, to enjoy the very best!  If Mr. Newman's ancestors WERE royal, he was continuing in the BEST of royal traditions, by sharing his bounty, (at a very reasonable cost), with those of us who admire all he did.  If his ancestors weren't royal....well, this truly delicious tea proves that ANYONE, no matter what their ancestry --  with enough heart, backing, and expertise -- can produce an exceptional-tasting tea at reasonable cost.<br /><br />""King Paul"" remains in our hearts, and in our happiest memories.  ""Queen Nell"" has our respect, our love, and our admiration.  This black tea -- the black tea that so many of us grew up on -- is our traditional tea, upgraded to a ""royal"" standard by being organic.  Mr. Newman's company also produces organic green tea, which has its own great taste and health benefits.  But for we traditionalists....black tea is it.  And organic black tea that is SO tasty, truly makes anyone who drinks it,<br />feel quite royal, indeed!"	0	0

-1	B0016FRI8A	A2NLZ3M0OJV9NX	Way too weak for my tastes	What can i say, I love iced tea. I drink a lot of it, and love the convenience of these new individual serving size packets. I am also a big fan of Stash products, or rather of all the other stash products I have tried.<br />I purchased a case of all 4 varieties,  (when i say i drink iced tea, i am not kidding) and these were all way too weak when i mixed them in my 16 ounces water bottle.<br />I finally found that i needed to dissolve 2 packets in a small bit of hot water first (if not the tea clumped on me), and than add a packet of sweetener before adding the rest of the water just to make these palatable.<br />unfortunately by doing that to this flavor, the ginger was out of control, and not in a good ginger tea sort of way.<br />Over all I am very dissatisfied with the product and will stick with the other brands that are out on the market.	1	0

It literally has bits of candy cane mixed into the cocoa mix and it is a refreshing ""warm you from the inside out"" hot cocoa drink. If you are someone that isn't sold on peppermint in your hot cocoa you just have to try it. The peppermint is very subtle but very pleasing to the palate. Truly different from any hot cocoa that I have ever enjoyed."	1	0
1	B003AVGSNO	A16BEFJBWRRWBS	Thank you for carrying this USA made item	"About two years ago we bought a product from China at Costco that was ""dog chews"".<br />I have an Australian Shepard that can chew up anything, and she ate the Costco chews and was literally coughing up blood.<br />I couldn't imagine it was the product, after all Costco is a good store.<br />We took her to the vet and she checked out fine.<br />So a month later the dog had been fine, decided to try again. Same Result, once sick dog, blood coming out of her mouth.<br />The chews did not cut her. We took her to the vet and he could find no reason for her to be bleeding, it was coming up from her throat. I called and reported this to a lot of people and heard from them similar stories. Only thing that bothered me was Costco didn't seem to care and didn't respond to our calls and letters, which were courteous, we didn't blame their store, just wanted them to know the product they were selling was harmful.<br /><br />Made me very upset that I was so stupid to trust anything from China, and especially that I gave it to my dog again. I still feel very badly about it, and have not bought ANYTHING from China since that day, nothing, not cloths or shoes, nothing. Makes it hard to shop in Wally-world.<br /><br />Thank you for carrying these products."	0	0

The genius behind this decision should be tarred and feathered and run out of town on rail... ok, then, just fire them. The Altoid customer base, I would imagine, prefer natural ingredients and don't want crap... this is crap. The marketing genius behind this decision canNOT be a regular user of Altoids... any regular user would have known better... don't destroy a winner to make it look ""pretty"". I'm eating them for pete's sake, not dating them.<br /><br />Same with the Spearmint. Ruined by artificial color and ingredients.<br /><br />Duh... I guess I am too stupid to know the difference... Duh.<br /><br />I am still buying the Peppermint... for now. As far as I know, it is the only Altoid mint that still uses natural peppermint oil and no artificial colors... for now.<br /><br />OOoh oooh... how about this, marketing geniuses at Altoid... artificially colored red stripes in the Peppermint. Brilliant! Seriously, anybody that sees this and think it's a good idea needs to be FIRED."	4	1

-1	B00170NWEI	A328S28RVN3A15	Just don't like it	I am sure that there are people who like Rishi Sencha Tea, but I just don't like it. To me it it smells like hay. Other teas I tried, like Golden Yunnan or Pu-erh Tuo Cha Tea are even worst. Out of four Rishi teas I tried only the Earl Grey Loose Tea is acceptable. As for Green Tea - I like the Japan Sencha Green tea packaged by the Coffee Bean Direct. Anyway, You will not know which tea you like until you tried them all.	1	7
1	B00060PTLO	A7Z1QNOE2VLKD	Great to have on hand	I have never been a fan of instant coffee, so the only reason I purchased this was to use in a homemade kahlua recipe.

He took this in for his turn (without telling them anything about it) and probably half the office commented how good it was and asked where he got it--and requested he bring that variety again. So it looks like this will be a regular purchase for us.<br /><br />Direct from hubby: A very smooth and robust tasting coffee. I prefer the stronger varieties and this one does not disappoint! The first pot I mixed as I normally do for a new coffee, wow intense! I then backed down to a normal mix and enjoyed the pot more. I highly recommend this coffee to anyone that is seeking the deep, robust taste of a European coffee.	0	0

1	B000V9NFAW	AUV3OR951650C	Expensive, but very good. Intriguing... makes you get a second cup!	Never having bought REALLY expensive coffee like Kona, I was hesitant to spend the price on this one. However, I have having a hard time finding a light roast decaf coffee that had the flavor that I wanted, so I reluctantly decided to spend the money on it.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed was how SMOOTH my cup of coffee was... very creamy.  I LOVED that.  Then the aftertaste kicked in; a strong, intriguing flavor that was not at all unpleasant. I don't know how to exactly describe it, but it did make me go back for a second cup; I wanted to try it iced too!  It was top notch iced with some chocolate; it has a strong enough flavor but in a light roast so you don't get that burnt flavor, but it REALLY stood out with the chocolate flavor with it.  It seemed to be very low acid as well, it didn't eat at my stomach the way that the Sumatra coffee I had been drinking lately had.<br /><br />I'm still not sure if I can justify the price of the coffee for the flavor, but I suspect I will be back for more!  The more I write about it the more I want to go brew up a cup... and although it's 8:30 in the evening, it IS decaf, so I can, right? :D	0	0

Kiwi, raspberry, and strawberry juice concentrates are lesser ingredients; apple and grape juice are in the majority. And so what if it has 100% of the RDA of Vitamin C. So do a lot of other things. Is it possible to OD on vitamin C?<br /><br />The bottom line, though, is no matter what the combination of juices is, it tastes like cheap candy. Not pleasant at all."	1	1

-1	B005K4Q1VI	AF3ZIGIYXZUMH	You get what you paid for	Well you get what you paid for. While this milk chocolate k-cup is pretty cheap $12.95 per 24 (54 cents per count) but it is not good. It tasted like watered down chocolate (as if you put in too much water and not enough milk or chocolate/cacao for that matter). This thing is sweet tho, in fact kinda too sweet for my taste (i am beginning to think half of the powdery content is sugar/sweetener). I thought it was the amount of water that made it taste watered down so I lowered the cup size from 8 ounce to 6 ounce on my Keurig brewer and it's the same thing.	0	0
-1	B002OFZIV0	A34QJTH3WYLD5H	dark meat	All and all it is my fault because I did not pay attention to what I ordered. When I went to the Jack's Links website it advertised white meat 95 to 97 percent fat free. At the time they did not have this product for purchase. So when I received an email saying it was now available I hurried and ordered it. It is not until I received the order did I realize I had ordered dark meat. I did not even know that dark meat was available; therefore, I was shocked and felt deceived. Yet, I had tasted the chicken nuggetts before reading the content and was wondering why was it so salty. I did get a formal apology in writing from jack's links but again it is still my fault for not paying attention. Now I am stuck with many packets of dark meat chicken nuggets. In conclusion, I guess it is still a little bit healthier than the beef. (maybe)	0	1

1	B000EM6PC6	A3VQ1CNF6CMH3E	comparable to Irish breakfast	I actually bought a box in Walmart. It was, needless to say, inexpensive so I thought it was worth a taste test. One cup was Barry's Classic blend(loose), one cup Tetley (bag) and the other was Lipton (loose). Tetley's came in a distant-distant 2nd while Barry's and Lipton were tied for first. Both were very similar in body, richness and strength. A word of warning-don't ever buy cheap (in quality) loose or bagged tea. It will be stems and bits of leaves swept up from the floor-at least that is what it looks and tastes like. The tea should be just leaves as dark brown as semi sweet chocolate. All good (and some bad) tea is grown in Africa, India and Sri Lanka ( Ceylon).	1	0
1	B000DZKKK2	AX56NP6TLYN56	Excellent flavor and good price	I order these on a yearly basis for my gluten-intolerant girlfriend.<br /><br />Pros:<br />She loves these, which can be tough to do because she still remembers her pre-gluten-free days<br />They are easy to make (although she has me make them most of the time because I never over mix them, her's always have a cake consistency)<br />Well priced on Amazon, unlike in most stores<br /><br />The girlfriend is so impressed with Pamela's products, she has subscribed to the monthly newsletter and received countless recipes we love (e.g., gluten-free crepes).	0	0
1	B001AJ1ULS	A3FC5Y7XCEEOXY	my dog loves these! made in china... so what?	My dog absolutely looooves these treats! He even got the cat hooked on them lol They taste terrific (i try everything i buy for my dog before i feed it to him because if i think it's nasty, i will not force him to eat it either) however, the Made In China on the back of the package was a very very scary discovery. After reading some of the 1 starred reviews on Amazon bashing the product bc it's manufactured in China i decided to google it and i found nothing about Dogswell being affected by the recall. Here's a letter from Marco Giannini, the CEO of Dogswell & Catswell http://www.catswell.com/data/fe/File/letter.pdf<br />These are posts by Marco Giannini defending his products on itchmoforums.com http://itchmoforums.com/profiles/dogswell-u1427.html;sa,showPosts;start,30	1	3
1	B000PDY3P0	A2ZA47332X5R3T	Makes great Popcorn	This stuff worked really well for a school fundraiser.  Everyone loved it and there were very few kernels left after it popped.  Others complained about the oil being solidified but that happens when it gets cold.  After we had it outside for a while it all liquified but it works fine either way, I just squeezed the package and it came right out.  Great product...I will purchase it again if we do another fundraiser.	0	0
1	B000VKYKTG	A1PZN8AP463DG	Very Happy with Pocky Sticks	Of the many purchses I made on Amazon this past December, I was most pleased with the Pocky Chocolate Cream Covered Biscuit Sticks (Pack of 10). They arrived on time, and they were a 'hit' as a surprised gift. Be sure to keep them refridgerated.	2	0
1	B0013NUGDE	A1NYT53G77JTJ3	Good Chips - Better for You!	Saw these chips about 9 months ago and bought the BBQ  at a Giant store in their organic section.<br />These chips are light but tasty and have a good BBQ flavor.<br />Of course they aren't  Herr's or Lays but a good for you substitute. These chips are popped like pop corn. The package explains the process.<br />Trader's Joe's, sells their version for $1.99 a dollar less than Giant but I swear they are the same chips with different names.<br />Try them.	0	0
1	B0000VYKXC	A3L88AH6MABEDL	Best coffee I've tasted. I try others but always come back.	If you like a strong but smooth flavorful coffee this is it. I have tried others and just keep coming back to this one. My second joice would be the Starbucks Italian blend.	0	0
1	B00284TR82	A2YKP1BTRUV92U	International Delight	We like this coffee creamer and have been using it for years. So our main concern with ordering it was would any of the individual containers break. We received the item with none of the containers broken. So for the cost this is a great buy.	0	0
1	B001E5DXEU	A2PK2UGLPMFTON	Coffee/tea snob's favorite chai	I've been buying Big Train Vanilla Chai since 2002-2003ish, and it is by far my favorite chai that I have found. The taste and texture is smooth, and flavorful... I tend to like my chai rich, so I mix it with milk instead of water. I also like to add BT to my coffee (with a touch of milk) when I'm in the mood for sweet pick-me-up :) My husband likes to mix Big Train Vanilla Chai mix in his Tazo Chai tea for a little extra spice once in a while, but he does like BT all on it's own. It's always a big hit with company too. :)	0	0
-1	B000ELWDRI	A2D8ER4FCS0HM1	Bland and disappointing..	I was familiar with a few of Wolfgang's recipes before I tried any of his soups. First I tried a different flavor a year ago, but can't remember anything except it being bland and slimy.  I decided to try it a 30 minutes ago because I was desperate for something healthy and convenient because I was a tad sick and could not make my own unprocessed meal with the ingredients I had home. I bought it for about $3 and hoped I just had a bad can of soup the first time, but this was just awful. No taste, slimy, and hardly any chicken (probably 3-4 tiny pieces). I can see why they added such little chicken. It's just tasteless and dry; tasted nothing like chicken. I'll go try another can of soup that can make me feel a bit better. This sure didn't do it. I have never had soup that tasted bland even after adding salt and seasoning. I see positive reviews that make me thing I had another bad can because I still can't believe it had absolutely no flavor.	2	0
1	B000H227BG	A173J9JR52Z489	Ghirardelli chocolate mocha hot cocoa-16 oz. can	If you've never tried any of Ghirardelli's hot cocoa products you are in for a treat! Made with milk, the cocoa is far superior to any other cocoa product on the market. I don't drink coffee, but have a cup of this every morning. When made in the Froth Au Lait hot chocolate/latte maker, you will get the best cup of hot cocoa you ever had.	6	0
1	B007M83302	A3IUW081KXD3PE	Love the original - not so much the jalapeno or the sweet potato.	We've re-ordered the original potato Popchips several times since we first tried them.  They are perfect for snackers who crave salty crunchy things more than sweets.  There's only 100 calories per bag and you actually get enough to feel satisfied.  We've tried the sweet potato and jalapeno flavors with less desirable results.  They taste too manufactured to us - the flavor is too intense.  We much prefer the basic original chip that remind us so much of Munchos.  They are nicely salty and have a great crunch.  They would make great crunchy toppings in recipes as opposed to breadcrumbs though I haven't tried anything beyond slipping a few onto my turkey sandwiches.  (Right, like you've never done it.)	0	0
1	B004391DK0	A3156S6OVZJHHN	Amazing!	We have been living gluten-free for 5 years now, and this mix is the best I have found!  It makes great waffles.	1	0
1	B0030VBRIU	AURSNGP18EH56	Twins love it and so do I	Convenient packaging and the babies love it.  They just gobble it right up.<br /><br />This flavour is the best one out of the HappyBaby line of pouch foods.  The worst I would have to say is the Amaranth Ratatouille.  Chick Chick has a nice subtle flavour and nice texture.<br /><br />Highly recommend!	1	0
1	B004ZIER34	AG36DMYKO3HPM	This Coffee is NOT Bad!	I deal with GERD frequently, which limits my ability to have coffee.  When I saw this product being offered through the Amazon Vines Program, I was intrigued and thought I would give it a try.  The French Roast is not my first choice of coffee flavor and, at the same time, the taste isn't bad at all!<br /><br />I'm hoping that the Low Acid Coffees will be offered in different flavors so I could test them as well.  What I would like, even more, if there was an option to make individual cups similar to the Keurig system as I don't need to make a full pot just for myself.  (I don't own a Keurig system so I would have to improvise in making single servings.)	0	0
1	B003DKY5R8	A17WKJUZPRWGY9	Convenient and tasty too!	Great taste. There is a slight bitterness to this tea, but it's black tea - it's bound to be a little bitter, especially for being so strong. The strength is perfect for customizing to taste. Some people like strong tea while others like theirs very mild, so you can add more water if you want. I like to make a fairly strong tea (the melting ice dilutes it just fine) and sweeten it myself. I like sweet tea, but usually when I get it, it just tastes like sugar water. These give me the strong tea flavor I love, and I can add the perfect amount of sweetness. Great product!	2	0
1	B000G0EP78	AB5UZ4BGCNW02	"Just like the ""real"" thing!"	"I bought this mix to help curb some of my cravings for ""regular"" breads.  I tried the simplist recipe on the box - drop biscuits, just add water and bake.  My biscuits didn't rise as much as those in the picture on the box, but they tasted so delicious! Even my kids devoured them.  A great staple for the carb-conscious person. I recommend highly."	23	0

-1	B002BCE9JS	A3UNJWEQ456K0A	Not too good	As a Vietnamese, I wouldn't buy this product again. Nothing near the Korean Assi brand of Pho that I've had before, but which I couldn't find on Amazon.	0	0
1	B00126EQ8I	A3O646NL6SH3ZL	The real deal (ALMOST)	I pass around favorable endorsements very seldom but this is one of those occasions.<br /><br />I'm almost 69 and this bacon would be as almost identical to the bacon I ate if it were a bit saltier and had the rind left on.<br /><br />If you want the old time southern bacon without all the salt and the rind, this is it.<br /><br />I'll admit I do salt the bacon just a tad before I fry it.<br /><br />This is good stuff if you appreciate great bacon.	1	0
1	B000I1RHMU	AJ6WBHBHP4ACI	very nice	The Earl Grey and Green tea mix is very smooth and a nice delicate flavor from the bergamot oil.<br />A nice way to start or end a day!  I enjoy this in the evening with my treat of Chocolove 70% cocoa<br />strong dark chocolate.  Ends every day nicely.	0	0
-1	B0002Q1X6C	A3AIIFXEEHKQWX	No stars for this expensive garbage	Zero stars for this item.  I couldn't even confirm that the wrinkled little animal-offal sort of thing is a truffle.  This lacks any aromatic attraction at all.  I'd be afraid to put it in anything I planned to eat for fear it would ruin the entire item.<br /><br />As for the famous JR service, my complaints about this product have been ignored.	2	0
1	B001LXYA5Q	A24VFSMK05PXXJ	Made for one interesting night!	"Heard about these and simply had to check them out. Ordered a package and invited a few friends over after a huge shopping trip for an evening of ""flavor tripping."" That is exactly what it was, the tablets themself have an odd taste (not the best) but for two hours afterward everything we ate was completely different from anything I've had before. Lemons, kiwi, strawberries, cheese, mustard, cranberry juice, OJ, and a lot more. IT all was completely different and was like experiencing these foods for the first time. Everything was sweet and tasted (with few exclusions) much better. I ended up eating whole lemons by the end because they were my favorite.<br /><br />These really are amazing and I would recommend them to anyone who likes food."	1	0
1	B0018RXITE	A13EKRN1EAE9T0	Very good organic Sunbutter	Per the manufacturer, the product is organic and only made from Sunflower seeds.  It tastes very natural and fresh.  I would highly recommend if you like the natural taste of Sunflower seeds.	0	0
1	B002TMV34E	A1PW5SQLR0Z6IH	Just plain good	I am not a coffee connoisseur by any means. I only know what I like and what my family likes to drink.  Gourmet coffees to me taste pretty much the same as a good ole can of generic coffee.  Until I tried the Melitta Cafe Collection Classique Supreme Ground Coffee.  First off I noticed that the flavor was not too strong.  I am not a fan of coffee that tastes like sludge and lean towards the medium to light roasts most of the time.  Secondly, it smells great brewing.  I know I am having a good coffee day when I can smell it.  The taste is delicate but flavorful.  I tried it black, black with equal, and then black with equal and powdered creamer (my favorite flavoring) and each time, the coffee was enjoyable.<br /><br />I would definitely buy this coffee again.  It comes in a pack of three for only eighteen dollars which is comparable to other brands of coffee that taste ten times worse.  The only negative thing I can say is that the bag is 11-ounces and not a full pound.<br /><br />In fact, I think I'll got make a pot now!<br /><br />Natalie S.	0	0
-1	B001LGGH40	A26U7D0N4PCTNT	Not a fan of flavored carbonated water	As the title says I'm not a fan of fizzy water and that taste definitely comes through in this drink. The 'tang' of this product assaults your mouth right from the first sip.  It smelled nice. But really it was just so sweet and carbonated that the experience was not enjoyable.  There no discernable taste of kiwi or strawberry, just a blast of sugar and bubbles. The 3 people under 11 in our familiy loved it but - as we knew they would.<br /><br />No thanks.	1	0
1	B00213ERI0	A1AHFH04E4DH6P	All natural and delicious	Dr. Lucy has created an absolute masterpiece. These cookies are delicious for everyone. There are so many additives in today's food, that it is nice to know that there is a product that is completely natural.  You also have the feeling that you can trust this product, since you know that she created this for her own child. The calorie count is less than other cookies, and it also does nto affect diabetics as significantly as regular cookies do. I highly recommend this product, as well as her other cookies. While I do love chocolate chip, my absolute favorite would be the cinnamon.  Enjoy!!	1	1
-1	B003MPKGKE	A1CV93020DJXB4	Oh, nuts.	I bought this for fathers day. My father loves dried fruits and nuts.<br /><br />It came in a somewhat cute crate box, and each compartment was in a plastic bag. That means that if you don't eat the nuts in one sitting they will go stale, as they are now sitting in the open. Same story for the fruit.<br /><br />While all the bags were closed when my father opened them he found that the nuts were stale and the fruit were hard/chewy.<br /><br />I recommend purchasing this if you need a centerpiece, but not if you actually want to eat it.	7	0
-1	B00284TR82	ANB3U8VO5BY72	BEWARE!	Amazon outside packaging arrived in great shape!  Unfortunately downhill from there.  Carton containing creamers was damaged; original box seal was taped over (re-sealed previously opened?); use by date on outside of box indicated 4 months (typically these have at least 12 months, usually 18). Sent feedback to Amazon several days ago.  Apparently fell on deaf ears (i.e., no response from Amazon).	2	1

1	B00561TQXK	A38SQACXZ9DU71	Best diet soda so far....	SANS root beer has &lt;1 carb and zero calories. I have been on the hunt for good soda without sugar, aspartame or sucralose for a long time. I tried Zevia and think that the SANS root beer is much better. No weird aftertaste and it's not heavy tasting, just light and refreshing. I actually finish the entire can and I never did that with Zevia. I highly recommend SANS root beer soda!	3	0

Not only is the aroma delightful, the flavor is excellent as well.  I drink my coffee black and this one has no bitter after taste and the flavor isn't overpowering.  The flavor is a very light coconut and the coffee is a medium body.  I must admit that I was a little hesitant about a ""coconut"" flavor.  DON'T BE!  Everyone around me wants a cup....I refuse to share!"	21	0
-1	B001E5E2PO	A3JJEBQKMC5ZXH	Little more than sugar syrup	Just Sweet, no flavoring that I could taste.

As I was playing w/my daughter who is 20 months, she said ""mommy tummy hurts"" and I heard it gurgling.  Her dad heard and said:  ""...well I opened a new can of Oatmeal yesterday, and it smelled horrible, looks very different than past cans"".  Sure enough, I opened it and it was horrible smelling and looked bad  (as noted in other reviews, dark grey flakes mixed in, much darker than normal).  There MUST be something wrong - I plan to contact the company tomorrow and would NOT recommend right now."	4	2
1	B000G1769G	A3OCM8R6HC4QEG	Brings back memories!	I'm pregnant, and lately have been craving foods from my childhood (like peanut butter sandwiches, barbecue chips, apple juice). I've been in a soup mood lately and bought a bunch of Amy's soups at Whole Foods. This soup is light and delicious, and tastes like spaghetti O's! Of course it is more soup-like and healthier, but that's what this reminded me of!	0	0
1	B000F9Z1WI	AHQ13I9CI4US6	Oreo Thin Crisps work for me	Of all the 100-calorie pack snack products I've tried (and there have been many!) these are my absolute favorites. The funny thing is that I don't even like Oreos, and am not that crazy about chocolate. However, these Thin Crisps are exactly that, thin and crisp. They are also just right to fend off sweet cravings or premature hunger.	0	0
1	B003ULJJN0	A11OTLEDSW8ZXD	Aromatic and subtly sweet	Aaah, this is the kind of tea I enjoy on a cold night.  I like to let the bag set for five minutes for a true minty sensation.  It smells like wintermint, and the caffeine formula allows me to enjoy this late in the evening when I want to relax.<br /><br />This tea leaves a slight minty taste in my mouth for a while after drinking this.  I only use one teaspoon of sugar to add sweetness as this tea is naturally tangy-sweet.<br /><br />The only drawback is the price.  This is the kind of tea I'll reserve for guests, or as fillers for Christmas stockings for my tea-drinking friends.	3	0

1	B000KV61FC	A21V2KRG4Y74PQ	Fantastic way to feed your dog	I got this when a trainer recommended that I find ways to make life more entertaining for my dog. Apparently dogs find working for their dinner to be entertaining. It actually is really great. I just unscrew the bottom, pour the kibble in, and then my dog spends the next 20-30 minutes getting it out. And he does seem entertained - I think eating his food slower makes him feel fuller too. I mix this up with a couple of other kibble dispensers so he doesn't get too used to just one way - then it would be boring again. One warning - the med/large is really good. My friend has a small and a full cup of kibble fits easily into it. Unless you are feeding your dog a lot, you probably don't need the big one.	2	0

Packaging was not damaged and cans were bubble wrapped inside the box so it wasnt packaging or delivery. These cans were sold and shipped already dented. Don't blame UPS.

1	B006H32PWU	A3LE67UTFF4AQJ	Great way to enjoy in bulk - Cranberry Pomegranate	The Cranberry Pomegranate herbal tea from Stash is one of my favorites, but this flavor is not always readily available where I live.  I was happy to find this bulk supply here on Amazon.  Instead of being packed in the standard 18-count boxes that are sold in stores, this item is packaged as a dozen individually wrapped packs of 10 tea bags in a specific flavor.  Each tea bag is sealed in its own flavor-saving pouch, just like the retail packaging, but this bulk version takes up much less space in your cabinet, while still keeping each tea bag fresh until use.  Buying in bulk like this is a great way to stock up on a favorite flavor while saving a little bit of money.  The tea itself is full flavored; a perfect selection for those who enjoy fruit-flavored herbal (and caffeine free) teas.	0	0

-1	B001LG945O	A31BZEQMPKS5MY	Not my favorite	I have a tendency to avoid products with artificial sweeteners, and this includes sodas with high fructose corn syrup.  The Switch is a line of fruit juice sodas with no added sweeteners--not even cane sugar.  It has carbonated water, fruit juice, some natural flavors and colors, and vitamin C.  If you're going to drink soda, carbonated fruit juice is the best way to go.<br /><br />The Switch has several flavors, including Orange Tangerine.  However, it's clear some flavors are better than others.  The Orange Tangerine has a harsh aftertaste that another flavor I tried does not.  I've tried other citrus juice sodas and enjoyed them, but something went wrong in the flavoring of this particular soda.  If you're looking for an orangey soda, try Izze's Sparking Clementine instead.	0	0
1	B000FDDFUE	AV624G630GQB	Good stuff	As with all the Ryvita Crispbread's I've tried, these are very filling, taste great and you can eat them with absolutely no guilt.  At 35 calories per crispbread and no fat or sugar, you can eat three and be completely satisfied without having blown your diet.  I eat them with some fruit as an afternoon snack.  They perfectly balance the sugar hit you get from the fruit and keep you going for hours.	5	0
1	B000H227BG	A335KHZWGASJFJ	The Chocolate side of Mocha	While you would expect Ghiradelli to make good chocolate, the flavor of this mocha cocoa is precisely that of great darker chocolate flavor, using just enough coffee flavor to accent the cocoa without overtaking it.  A smooth, delicious start or finish to your day - even a warm afternoon pick me up on those chilly days!	0	0

1	B004R8J8E0	A105S56ODHGJEK	A dinner classic.	"Shake N Bake is a longtime favorite in our household. This pork version does what it's supposed to do: It gives your pork a tasty, slightly crispy and flavorful coating that doesn't completely overpower the flavor of the pork itself. Don't let the ""pork"" label fool you into believing it's one-dimensional, however, because this could just as easily be used on chicken as well. In the end, it is more expensive than bread crumbs, but in my opinion the flavor and convenience are worth it. Can't go wrong with a dinner classic like this."	0	0

1	B0001LO39C	A3IJ4EJWNYQJ2I	The world of Chai!	For any of you tea lovers out there, this brand of Chai has got to be the best.  FORGET Starbucks!  There is so much flavor bursting out of that tiny little bag, you wonder how they packed it all in.  I've even attempted to make my own chai, figuring hey, if it's fresh, it's better.  Not so here.  The only thing that compares is German Fruchte-tee (which is so much better than American herbal teas) that engulfs the water with red juice the moment you touch hot water to the tea bag.  Definately worth buying in bulk.	2	0

1	B004391I3C	A32DV6IF316BC0	Wonderful flavor!	"I've tried several different varieties of Dolce Gusto coffee capsules and so far this is my favorite. It's the most versitile too. It makes a great expresso if you use a demitasse cup, cappuchinno if you add your own milk, or a 14 oz mug of American-style coffee. I'm so hooked I drink two big mugs a day - one truly delicious vice.<br /><br />This coffee is strong and dark but not harsh or bitter. Other strong or ""full-bodied"" coffees often have a burned taste - as if burning the beans is the only way to add flavor to an inferior bean.<br /><br />Nescafe, the largest selling brand of coffee in Europe, has developed a fantastic coffee. I also love the convenience of individual servings."	1	0

1	B0045XE32E	A3TX46J8SBZPG3	Lindy and Gracie like 'em	To properly test this product, I had to go to my experts - our dog and her walking friend.  Most mornings, after their walk with their moms, they return to our house to play in the yard.  My role is to greet them with a tasty treat - usually a Gravy Bone, which they love.  This week I've been mixing in these treats and, based on the experts' reaction, they are quite popular.  They seem to come from a safe source and have good ingredients.  So, get some for your pup.  Hurry up, will you?  They're waiting.	1	2

I was disappointed. It was mild and rather tasteless. I understand that organic teas tend to be less brisk than non-organic, but I've ordered a favorite organic Assam from another well-known tea purveyor, and it was heads above this Newman blend. I got what I paid for with the Newman, but at least I'm not out a whole lot of money."	0	0

1	B008G01KM8	A1H1DVTIHXV3YE	Good Malta, baffling business model	I've never had Sunchy Malta before (I drank a lot of Goya when it was available locally). Tastes similar to Goya, though with less of a sour taste and slightly less carbonation.<br /><br />I ordered 50 bottles in order to get free shipping. Said bottles arrived in 4 large boxes, with each bottle individually packed. None broke. At the time of purchase, this was the best deal going for Malta either locally or in stores (I've never paid less than fifty cents anywhere).<br /><br />Now, though, the free shipping is gone. Unless  Sunchy seriously expects me to drop $7.50 for shipping per bottle, it's unlikely I'll be buying anymore. They should consider selling by the pack or case if they wish to pursue the online business model.<br /><br />So, 5 stars for value and the quality of packing, with the caveat that I won't be buying any more until Sunchy figures out how to sell it.	0	0

1	B001BSBFUO	AIUC6VT4VT01A	These pill pockets literally saved our dog's life	"I was so relieved when I found this product. Our doberman was having serious skin allergies and had to take antibiotics and steroids in pill form. He was so crafty with the pills - we would hide them in wet dog food, only to find the food eaten and the pills spit out. We hid them in salami, raw meat, pastrami, turkey, soft cheese, hard boiled egg, anything that you could think of that is appetizing to a dog and he would eat the food and spit out the pills. It got so bad that he actually stopped eating and drinking. He was so sick. Our vet put him on IV fluids and steroids and antibiotics and these wreaked havoc on his liver. We were so worried. He was going down the drain. Then I found this product. Simple as that, we put the medicine in the treat and he wolfed it down. He actually got to the point that when the 6 hour time was coming around to ""get the treat"" he would start whining and staring at the refrigerator where I had prepared the whole dosage plan ahead of time and put them into a plastic box with big lettering, ""THIS IS ALEX'S MEDICINE - NOT CHOCOLATE!"" We had a close call with my little sister - they looked appetizing to her as well! :) Now I use these for his vitamins and for anything that he has to take that is not appetizing. Really a life saver!"	0	0

-1	B0001IVR8A	AD9KNBAUADSAA	"Just ""o.k "" if you want a ""Frosty"" or a rich shake"	Obviously, by looking at the other reviews people think this stuff is either really good or really bad. I think it is all according to your taste and what you are expecting for this price. I ordered packets from two different web sites and they both taste ok just like a frosty/rich shake ordered from a drive thru window. It was ok but I wouldn't pay the price for it again. I found a recipe from the Serendipity 3 restaurant where you make your own Frozen Hot Chocolate by adding tiny bits of REAL chocolate, a bit of milk, cocoa,and some ice into a blender. I have a feeling that is the recipe that taste much more like what Oprah said was so good and more equivalent to what the restaurant actually serves. If you want more than just an expensive milkshake I would try the recipe using real chocolate and stay away from this drive thru milkshake mix.	12	4
-1	B006JG8ALK	A24SWJQ5VM47YP	Not that good	I love coconut but this bar is a disappointment.  The first bite had an odd flavor but after a couple more it got a bit better.

At 246 calories, 14g fat 33g carbs and 29g sugar, this bar is not worth it at all.	0	1

1	B001EO5ZMO	A1C5SHU81SRARN	Best Ahmad Tea	I've tried a variety of Ahmad tea. Not because I particularly like this brand, but they are just easier to come across.  The Imperial blend, I believe, is the most complex yet well balanced of all the ones I've tried. It's full body like a good cup of Assam, which by no means overpower the delightful, clean taste of Darjeerling, complete with a long lasting note of bergamot. I enjoy it best in the evening. It gives a satisfying and relaxing finish to a busy day.<br /><br />For those interested in the specifics: I use about 3 teaspoons of lose tea in a stainless steel infuser in a 16 oz mug, let it steep in 208F water for 2-3 min, take the infuser out, and drink it without sugar or milk to savor its sophistication.	0	0

These treats and all Dogswell treats are made in China,I researched all over the web about this matter and bottom line is: why take the risk? A few sites say it is OK, most say to be cautious and others say don't buy.I threw out all the ones I bought and got new ones made in USA.I wish Amazon gave us the choice of ""made in USA"", for now I recommend everyone that has a pet to read the labels of the treats and food.

1	B002EDF82G	A1QIN5VH8CYYBG	THE BEST CHEESE EVER!!!	If you haven't been introduced to Saint Andre soft cheese you are not living.  It's like Brie mixed with butter.

I can't imagine it is very heart healthy but makes the absolute best baguette for breakfast instead of butter.  I am a cheese person and I eat cheese from a number of EU countries and this ranks as one of if not the best.  Enjoy and keep the red wine flowing.  Buon appetit!	3	0
1	B006N3I84I	A9BXUK4ZHEYMA	Love Tully's Italian Roast	I am a very picky coffee drinker.  I don't know or follow what critics may view as the best coffee, only my own taste buds.  There is just something great about the aroma and taste of this Italian Roast. As mush as I didn't want to give any of mine away, I wanted others to try it and hear if they agree and THEY DID. I had everyone asking where I bought it so they could get their own.  Now I am out and need to buy more.  I thought it would be no big deal b/c I have more of another brand to drink, but it's just not the same, coffee in the morning can make your day and if it's not the right one....well, you know. I will continue to buy Tully's Italian Roast and so will my friends and family whom have tried it.	0	0
-1	B001E0T29K	A2WCAEZ4HT8RTT	A Protein Powder to make you Gag.	"I have tried many different protein powders over the years, and while it is hard to write a review based on taste alone (since everyone's taste is different), I'm going to go ahead and say this is the most rancid tasting gunk I have ever had the displeasure of putting in my mouth.<br /><br />I mix my protein shakes with a hand blender, so I rarely have any mixing problems - and even this protein mixed well.  The fun really began when I tasted it.  It tastes sour and acrid at the same time, absolutely horrendous.  I could not finish the shake I had mixed up, and had to wash my mouth out with apple juice to get that sick taste out before I could actually eat or drink anything else.<br /><br />This is a terrible protein powder from the standpoint of taste, in my opinion.  Of all the types I have tried, which is many, this has taken seat as the new ""worst"" one.<br /><br />FYI, I had ordered this with another brand because I am testing egg protein powders due to casein sensitivity.  If anyone has an egg protein powder recommendation, PM me."	0	0

I was so excited when Amazon started selling them. I bought 2 bags thinking I would get a decent size for the price. Sadly the bag is only 210g or 1/2 lb (smaller than a regular bag of chips). The bags I received would have cost about $3 in Canada. Not worth it for the $7 price offered on Amazon. This is the first time I have been disappointed with Amazon and their prices. This is not worth the investment.	4	2

Grade C is the third run with even more minerals and an even stronger taste of maple and it's slightly less pleasant for most people.<br /><br />Maple syrup has a large variety of minerals and vitamins and Grade B Organic is my favorite, considering it's stronger flavor and higher nutrition content. Of course, Organic is the only way to eat food now, but that's another story.<br /><br />Coombs Family Farm provides a very satisfactory grade B organic Maple Syrup! I've used a lot!	203	9

Hence, when I saw these on the discount rack at the local Safeway I cleaned it out.  These are even better than the ones from the Amish market.

I was quite skeptical about stevia at first, but tried it with another brand and thought there wasn't much difference in taste and I felt better about using a more natural product than the other artificial sweeteners out there. I then started looking at getting a bulk container and happened upon this product. I now have purchased this same product 4 times and am quite pleased. The product is a bit more concentrated and we are using less of the product in our drinks and cooking than other competitors.<br /><br />The deliveries are always quick and we have not had any issues at all with the product or packaging.	0	0

It's lots of fun to watch her get the big yellow cups in her small grip, place them carefully all in one spot.  After a few times, she was able to grab all the cups placed in the red container the proper way.  She loves finding treats!	0	0

Pity that I tried it out<br />as an amzn multipack, guess it will go into my second harvest bin.  Like other reviewers mentioned, it has a slightly stale<br />smell to it -- perhaps they don't wash the quinoa enough before processing it?  I taste everything my babies eat, and have<br />to mention that it does not have the melt in the mouth texture of the other two besides not tasting good.  My babies will eat quinoa for eg<br />when I cook it for family meals.  And amaranth in flakes from their brother's cereals.  Buy a single can from whole foods<br />or target etc before buying a multi pack.  They won't even eat it if I put in one tablespoon to 5 of rice cereal.

1	B000DZKKKC	A1UPTUHCFW18X6	YUMMMMMMMMMMM	I love these cookies.  You just mix them all up in a bowl together and bake.  I ADD MORE CHOCOLATE chips- at least 1/4 cup more of whatever flavor I am craving at the time- or better yet chop up some chunks from a semisweet baking bar!  This makes it better, I think, as it doesn't have enough chocolate in them when I really need a chocolate fix.  The package says  to melt the butter.  You do not have to do that if you have a hand mixer with some guts.  Just use soft butter or butter substitute.  Also, watch how long they cook as mine never need the full time.  My kids like them softer so I bake shorter for them and make a crispier tray for me.  The only caveat is that each bag only makes a small batch and it is expensive.  BUT this is the BEST tasting gluten free mix I have ever found.  My kids love them and they are eaten quickly.	2	0
-1	B006N3IG4K	ATQCO4O4U8E78	Horrible: did something happen?	I bought this coffee because several people who also liked my favorite (Jet Fuel or Emeril's Big Intense Bold) liked this one. Typically Sumatra is one of my favorite coffees as well.<br /><br />I am wondering if they made a bad batch or gave it the wrong label.<br />It is **NOT** bold.

1	B000HDKZDC	A23TNRHKURH7YU	Best cereal bars on the planet	We use these for our daughter for a few reasons. One, they are healthier than other cereal bars on the market (whole grain). Two, they have yogurt incorporated into the bar. Three, the are thick and do not easily crumble. Since our daughter starting eating them when she was about 1, not having to clean up after she's eaten them is a BIG plus.<br /><br />Plus, they are super yummy for adults too.<br /><br />They are more expensive than others on the market (esp since I can get Nutrigrain bars in bulk at a discount) but they are worth it. Makes our life easier and they don't have a ton of added sugars!	4	0

It takes her about 10 minutes of chewing before finally devouring  and after 2 weeks, there is a noticeable improvement in her teeth and gums.  I do watch her to assure she doesn't try to swallow whole pieces but, so far, it hasn't been a problem.  I will be ordering more from Amazon as this packages dwindles.

-1	B000YSS7EO	A1A500282H039F	Buyer beware	We used to love this product feeding it to our son twice a day for several months.  About 3 months ago, we opened a can and there was definitely something wrong with it.  The consistency was clumpy instead of the normal light, fluffy flakes.  The color was off as well.  The most notable change was the terrible smell.  I did contact the company and they responded to me right away.  The answer made some sense and it has been quoted by others here in this forum.  My problem now is that it just makes no sense!  How on earth is there no recall or some other investigation of this product by the FDA?  It was very noticeable that it all but disappeared off of store shelves and online stores for a few weeks.  The price here on Amazon has gone way up.  I was still buying it but will no longer.  I was still opening cans that were rancid and others that are not.  It is not cheap so I can't afford to keep playing the guessing game on my dime.	6	1

They are much safer than raw hide chews given they are made from dried chicken, which means unlike raw hide you know these are actually digestible. This is the biggest reason I bought them. My vet recommended not giving my Sheltie raw hide as they aren't properly digestible. Whether this is true or not, I've heeded her advice.<br /><br />Baird, my Sheltie, really seems to enjoy them. When he sees one coming out of the bag, his tail is wagging like crazy. He enjoys these as much as our old family Sheltie McGyver enjoyed raw hide. The only difference I see between these and raw hide is that raw hide lasted roughly 30 minutes longer in chew time than these. I'd say Baird can chew through one of these in about 30 or so minutes, while our old Sheltie could chew on a single raw hide for an hour, at which point we would throw away the little nub. There is nothing left of these bones after 30 minutes.<br /><br />As far as the dental application goes, it does smell of mint, so I assume it should, if nothing else, help with doggy breath, though to be fair Baird has never really had ""doggy breath."" I also use some dog mouth foam so I don't know what really keeps his breath ""fresh"" between the two.<br /><br />If you aren't too sure about raw hide for your dog and want something you know can be digested, these are definitely worth it.<br /><br />For those that try to keep track of where the things they give their dog come from, these are made in China. I've tried finding something similar not made in China, but it seems such a thing doesn't exist or I just can't find them."	1	0

I was somewhat confused thinking ""how the heck can their be an ice cream of the month club?"" But, with having given and received numerous ""of the month clubs"" and having all great experiences in the past, I was curious to see what they had put together here. Needless to say, WHAT A FANTASTIC SURPRISE! The 4 boutique frozen deserts arrived packaged in dry ice and were completely frozen. My girlfriend and I were pretty enthusiastic to dive in and try them all, but took a step back to read the companies review on each of the vendors and brands. We decided that we would begin with the ""Berto's Gelato - Roasted Banana True Italian Artisan Gelato."" After a single bite, my girlfriend declared that it might be the best gelato she has ever had, and proceeded to eat most of it while we watched TV. The best description she give as she devoured the gelato was saying it was like having ""velvet wrapping around your body."" The additional flavors included in our shipment were Gilles Sherbet Swirl, Cedar Crest Elephant Tracks Ice Cream, and Oberweis Cookie Dough Classic. Each of the selections were very delicious and from companies I have never heard of. I highly recommend this club to any person looking to give or get an array of tasty desserts that you'll want to find more of once you're done!"	4	0

Seriously, aside from a slight headache which I quickly got rid of with some excedrid, I felt amazing on New Year's day.  Dont drink and drive, but also dont drink without Party Armor.

1	B005EL6VOY	A3H4TQYDGD7WM2	105 lbs of oats and counting.	I have been eating coach's Oats for about 3 years now, about 7 -  4.5lb bags a year. So much so I am starting to neigh and whinny. I have not last much weight but my blood work does look better, cholesterol is better and BP is down. It tastes great and have not grown tired of the taste. Easy to fix (2min40sec in the office microwave done perfect). Life is good.	0	0

1	B00622CYVS	A18NRCV2F8EYZM	Did a lot of research on this brand	"According to a lot of reviews on top baby food brands overall, Earth's Best was always voted to be in the Top 5 of all the lists of reviews by Mom Links, Consumer Reports, Livestrong, Baby Health Sites.  Here is a excerpt from one of the sites (I think it was from eHow.com):<br /><br />The Center for Science in the Public Interest evaluated popular brands of baby foods, including Gerbers, Heinz, Earth's Best and Beech-Nut. According to the Center's report, Earth's Best did not use starchy fillers or ""replace real food with water and thickening agents in many of their products for children over six months of age. Such adulterated products are nutritionally inferior to products made with more fruits and vegetables."" Earth's Best uses certified organic products. The brand offers single-ingredient, smooth foods for infants over four months; fruit, vegetable, grain and meat blends for babies over six months; and a variety of chunky soups, dinners and vegetable medleys for children over nine months old. Earth's Best products are sold at supermarkets, natural food stores and big box stores nationwide.<br /><br />Plus, my baby girl loves it.  Yes, it might be a little runnier than the other baby foods, but I just add a little rice with it and that fixes it."	8	0

I called Kellogg and they could really give me no good answer, and suggested I try another product of theirs, which i found not as good as this. I appreciate that Amazon offers this, and I will continue to order it.  By the way,  it really keeps me ""regular"", better than any other cereal.  Try it, you'll like it."	0	0

1	B004P4TL8E	AXUD3YCWLD7G3	Great K-cup Drawer!!!	"Works great. Definitely worth the $21.38. I read another review that the drawer sticks. I ran into this problem also. Easy fix, just bend the sides of the pull out drawer in (with a little bit of pressure). I was afraid that I might break it, but it seems to be very sturdy. Like I said just a little bit of pressure & the drawer slides out no problem. Believe me if it had issues I would never hear the end of it from my wife. Also I have my Keurig B40 on top of it with no issues of bowing, & there is enough room on the side to fit some containers ""Creamer & Sugar"". Makes the counter top a lot more functional."	0	0

1	B000H2405M	A1B1L9MFOZEYLG	Very Tasty Chili!!!	This is sooo tasty and very low in calories.  So many low cal foods don't have much flavor but this one has both.  I made a couple of changes - because I love the flavor of tomatoes I decreased the water from 7 cups to 6 cups and added a 15 oz. can of diced tomatoes to the water.  I also added a can of black beans (drained)to it.  I was trying to keep the calories down so didn't add meat but imagine that would be good also.  Try it....	2	0
1	B00141UC9I	A1I39PS6MDNXBS	my dog's favorite treat	my german shepherd loves these.  he's very picky about both his food and treats so it was a relief to find something he likes.  the package recommends giving him 4-6/day but that seems excessive--usually two or three throughout the day makes him happy.  they are in small strips, much like jerky--much less disgusting than some of his other treats, such as pigs feet/ears.  i will definitely continue to purchase.	1	1
1	B003DKY5R8	AECH84YQ3I23W	Too Strong, so Make More	This is definitely too strong if you make one glass from one K-cup. I've experimented. Now I run two K-cups through the large cup brew three times each. I add each cup to a pitcher. Then I add enough water to fill my three-quart pitcher. I sweeten it with Stevia, and add juice from one lime. Great iced tea!	1	0
-1	B003SBRUC4	A3C5WNH7C8RXWP	Unconsumable	Being a root beer lover I was excited to see Sky Blue Free at my local Earth Fare market. I mean, you can't go wrong with a natural soda, right? Wrong! Like the the other one-star reviewer, I thought it was bitter, had a chemical smell and ended with a horrible after taste. I've had good diet root beer and bad and this ranks as miles below the absolute worst. I'll stick with Diet Barq's, which is far cheaper and frankly is the best rootbeer, period!	3	3
1	B000Z978SS	A1GALZCXD8FHOR	A perfect, natural sugar substitute	Now Foods' erythritol is a sugar substitute made from corn. By fermenting the corn's sugars, the manufacturer produces a naturally-occurring sugar alcohol product. Sugar alcohols taste exactly like sugar, but without the calories and blood sugar spike. And they are alcohols in chemistry terms only, not to be confused with the kind of alcohol one finds in adult beverages.<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />* Tastes just like sugar and has no unpleasant aftertastes, unlike stevia.<br /><br />* Has a glycemic index of zero. Great for diabetics or those simply wishing to eliminate excess sugar from their diets.<br /><br />* Contains virtually no calories.<br /><br />* Made by a manufacturer committed to a wide range of sweeteners and food products, so the company is experienced and trusted in its field.<br /><br />* Erythritol occurs naturally in many foods. The FDA recognizes it as a viable and safe sugar substitute. Erythritol-based sweeteners have been on the market in other countries for years.<br /><br />* Unlike some other sugar alcohols such as xylitol, mannitol, and sorbitol, it will not cause gas if consumed in large amounts.<br /><br />* Not only does erythritol not promote tooth decay, it actually prevents it, inhibiting the growth of harmful bacteria in the mouth.<br /><br />* Can be used in baking.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />* Not quite as sweet as sugar. You need about a quarter to a third more erythritol by volume for an equivalent.<br /><br />* Though it tastes exactly like sugar, erythritol has a slight, mint-like, cooling effect on the tongue. In foods where that effect would be undesirable, erythritol would need to be combined with another sweetener to diminish the effect. (This effect seems to vary from person to person, too.)<br /><br />* In some clear liquids such as tea, adding erythritol will initially cloud the liquid, though the cloudiness fades quickly. (That issue probably comes from the release of oxygen bubbles as the product dissolves.)<br /><br />* Though it dissolves, erythritol does not do so as rapidly as sugar. It will retain its granularity in some foods. (Some people recommended powdering it to compensate.)<br /><br />* Because it involves more steps to make than corn syrup or sugar, this is not a cheap product. Perhaps in the future, economies of scale will drive the price down.<br /><br />Many companies are discovering the benefits of erythritol as a natural sugar substitute that lacks the nagging questions that dog artificial sweeteners like sucralose and aspartame. Now Foods' erythritol is one of the best values in this natural sweetener on the market, available at a much lower price point than some competitors' products. Though not cheap compared with sugar or some artificial sweeteners, as a healthy alternative, it more than makes up for its higher cost.<br /><br />Definitely recommended.	56	3

1	B008YGWIZM	A33947M1Y587GX	"This stuff is the ""put on everything"" sauce"	So I have sampled and bought my fair share of Everidae sauce and I have to say without a doubt it is the next best thing to put on food.  I will start off by saying I do know the maker of this sauce, and although that may seem like this review is a bit biased, i wanted to be the first to formally state the flavorful blend of this sauce can literally go on everything.<br /><br />I like spicy hotness, and unlike other condiments like Franks Red Hot, this doesn't mask the flavor of the food but adds to it.<br />I have used this sauce on hotdogs, hamburgers, chicken, tacos, and eggs.<br /><br />The mild is a little bit sweeter than the medium and hot(the hot being the heat that I particularly enjoy).  But this stuff can be added to almost any sauce or family recipe to give it that extra kick of spicy sweetness that will make your mouth water.	0	0

I was more than pleasantly surprised as these chips have a very satisfying robust taste and are crispy to boot.<br /><br />  How nice to be able to munch on these without worrying about too much salt.	2	1

-1	B001P737PC	A1XTP751P7VQ68	Cheaper Price - But Popcorn Older and Stale	Pop Secret is by far my favorite popcorn and I eat about 2 bags a day. I normally get the homestyle, but is was always to dry when I ordered on line so I went to the Butter thinking it wouldn't be so dry. No such luck. When I buy from the grocery store it is much more flavorable and fresh and it doesn't cost that much more. I checked the dates and the store vs online bulk was about 6 months different on average which probably causes the difference even though they both are in the sale by date range. with this said, I am going to have to discontinue buying this product online unless something changes and I'll really miss it coming straight to my door since I eat so much. I waited for 3 months of getting this product before posting because any company can have a bad batch of anything. Sorry. I hope this changes in the future!!	0	0

1	B002QWP89S	A33HGS0F6NVBRA	Greenies - Catnip for dogs	"I have been using Greenies for years, including the older formula that reportedly had digestion problems. However, we never have had any problems with Greenies. Just make sure you get the appropriate size for your dog. I have never seen a dog that could resist a Greenie. They will start doing tricks never seen before once you bring them into the house. They do help with their breath, teeth cleaning and training and we normally use them as ""well earned"" treats (they aren't the cheapest thing in the treat world). I just ordered 4, 27 oz. tubs of the Teenies (we have Papillons) and I know our dogs will enjoy every one of them. Never have to worry about our dogs getting fat eating these as we do not give them multiple times a day. The new formula reportedly has solved the digestibility problem and the manufacturer claims is now more digestible than normal dog food. In the original formula, the problem usually involved incidents when dogs just tried to swallow them whole or get it down in 2 bites. Our dogs always chewed them into small pieces avoiding any problems. Believe me, your dogs will love them."	23	0

1	B007M833A2	A39ANVSTOM4L6H	Yummy flavors!	So I wasn't convinced about the greatness of Popchips - until I tried them!! Now, although they are more expensive than regular chips, they are so much healthier and taste GREAT so I'm not sure I will ever buy regular chips again!<br /><br />However, even though I loved the basic flavors in the 6-flavor variety I wanted to try some of the different varieties because they sounded good. The only purchase option to try some of these other flavors was to buy a whole box, and I was very skeptical to buy an entire box of 24 if I didn't like the flavor. This variety pack gave me the perfect opportunity to sample each flavor to determine my favorites! I wondered what flavors I would be getting since they were not listed in the description, so in case it matters to you:<br />- Thai Sweet Chili (2 .8 ounce bags)<br />- Parmesan Garlic (2 .8 ounce bags)<br />- Jalapeno (2 .8 ounce bags)<br />- Cheddar (2 .8 ounce bags)<br />- Sweet Potato (2 .8 ounce bags)<br />- Sea Salt & Vinegar (2 .8 ounce bags)<br />- Salt & Pepper (2 .8 ounce bags)<br />- Chili Limi (2 .8 ounce bags)<br />- Sour Cream & Onion (2 .8 ounce bags)<br />- Barbeque (3 .8 ounce bags)<br />- Original (3 .8 ounce bags)<br />I haven't had a chance to sample all of the flavors yet, but the ones I have tried are wonderful. They taste healthy (although they aren't exactly healthy - they are the better alternative) very crunchy and full of flavor. The only flavor I don't really care for is the Original, and that's because it is pretty salty.<br />Don't be skeptical - try this variety pack and find your favorite flavor!	8	0

1	B000PDY3P0	AIL7KO1U5Y5HZ	Who needs to go to the movies?	This popcorn is da bomb!  Very yummy, even when cold and over 24 hours old.  (I know kind of gross)  I bought the 2.5 ounce so I could pop smaller portions in my 4 ounce popcorn machine.  Works like a champ.  The oil is coconut oil, same oil they use in theaters nationwide.  It is a solid and is a little difficult to get out and into the kettle while you try not to spill your corn and salt mixture.  I let the kettle heat up for about 3-5 minutes, then empty the oil in the kettle.  Immediate afterwords I pour in the popcorn salt mixture and less than 4 minutes BAM you are at the movies for about 1/56 of the price.  Healthy economical snack for the whole family.

-1	B001LG945O	AQ3IN3MRXQ5KH	Switch?  Ummm ... no.	I was looking forward to tasting the Switch Orange Tangerine drink since orange and tangerine flavors are two of my favorite but I was disappointed in the result.<br /><br />It was tangy. It tasted of ascorbic acid. It smelled of orange candy. It reminded me of breakfast. It reminded me of, yes, powdered Tang mixed with carbonated water followed by a strong unpleasant artificial aftertaste.  I found the the drink to be, simply, not very good.<br /><br />I tried to like the beverage and I did appreciate the concept but considering the unusual flavors, high calorie count of 140 cals/8.5 oz, and cost of almost a dollar/serving -- I cannot recommend Switch.	11	3
1	B008P18ZYO	A1CITHAQ9R2GSS	Yum! Delicious cardamom.	I couldn't find whole cardamom at 3 of my local supermarkets and the ethnic markets were too far. Luckily, I found whole cardamom here and it was perfect. First time I've ordered a spice online, and I'll admit it felt a bit odd at first... but after my experience, I wouldn't hesitate to do it again.	2	1
1	B0027E2M7Q	ADIKBFGQS2GHI	Exactly What I Expected	I like the jars because they are a little cheaper then the plastic gerber containers, but they don't reseal as easy. If you keep the open food in the fridge for the recomended time there is no problem.	1	0
1	B00412W76S	A3774UJAKO4FHI	Mild sweet tea	I've been watching the new Dr. Oz show and he recently recommended nettle tea. So I bought some and this happened to be the brand I chose.<br /><br />Nettle leaf tea is mild and sweet (I augment by using honey). Not absolutely sure of its benefits. It's touted as good for being a diuretic thereby keeping your kidneys clear and keeping bladder infections and kidney stones at bay. It's also suppose to help with arthritis. Dr. Oz had commented that it's suppose to help with head hair growth.<br /><br />I recommend it if for no other reason in that it's pleasant for those who like a less bitter type of tea.<br /><br />Alvita uses minimal packaging. The tea is in simple bags without strings or tags and smelled very fresh upon opening.	24	2

1	B008ZRKZSM	A3L5J6A4EIT2YV	For the health conscious peanut butter lovers!	Excellent product! I use it to make smoothies & peanut sauce for my Asian inspired dishes!

I really enjoyed this, tried it with my family and my dad was so skeptical at first but when he took a bit into the lemon he was flabbergasted! The look on his face was priceless. Best for groups of friends unless you experiment alone but the more the merrier! Wish it came with more berries per the price which is a bit steep for tablets and not the real berries which are hard to come by. People said it lasts only a couple minutes but for me it was a decent 15 minutes or more. Obviously the lemons with juice and other fruits will make it end quicker since there are liquids washing it out. Just have everything prepared and on the table before you take it!	1	0
-1	B006N3IG4K	A3A50F3ZWJ6V68	This coffee is now DECAFF!	One reviewer mentioned that this coffee was decaff and said it was listed as such on the bottom of the box (in small print). I checked my current box and saw no such labeling information. HOWEVER, the new boxes I received are a different color, with a slapped on label for Hawaiian Hazelnut and NOW the bottom of the box says it's made from 100% decaff coffee. While I like the flavor, I do NOT want decaff in the morning, which is when I drink coffee.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I am unable to return this item to Amazon because of their return policy, which is why I'm writing this review, to make sure others know the coffee packaging has changed and it is definitely labeled as decaffeinated now. I would give more stars for flavor, but the lack of official notification in the product description that this coffee is decaff makes me feel as if I tossed my money out the window, buying something I would not have otherwise ordered.	9	0

1	B0062A87HA	A2VKJ84Y83XR7K	Excellent Quality	I bought this organic pumpkin online because it is impossible to find pumpkin locally. I feed my dogs this every day because it is wonderful for their digestion. Pumpkin was recommended by my vet.  All of the cans were in great condition. There were just a few minor dents on a few of the cans, not anything serious. The quality of the pumpkin was so good that I would serve it to my family, but we really do not eat pumpkin!  An added plus was free shipping.  I would buy this again.	0	0

1	B001EPQ4HS	A1K82R24ROO2I7	Delicious AND decorative!	These are so pretty and the subtle plum flavor coupled with the toasty nuttiness of the sesame seeds gives the culinary curiosity seeker some taste-bud adventure as well as a unique visual display.<br /><br />This year [2011] I plan on making a non-traditional Christmas dinner with 5 different kinds of Sushi and I can't wait to use these for my Sushi. I'm going to buy the green Wasabi sesame seeds by Roland next month so that I can do a cute red and green inside-out Sushi. Maybe I'll even take a picture and upload it to Amazon.com if it turns out well.<br /><br />The bottles are convenient in size and I like the little twist-off lids for shaking the seeds on your choice of food. I like to shake some of these on my stir-fries and soups after plating. If you stir these into something during cooking, their pretty color WILL wear off, so they are best used after cooking rather than during.<br /><br />Note: These plum sesame seeds are NOT vegan. These contain 'carmine' which comes from beetles for the red coloring.<br /><br />Here are the ingredients listed on my bottles:<br /><br />Sesame Seeds, Seasonings, Salt, Citric Acid, Natural Plum Powder, Carmine, Spices, Sugar.<br /><br />These are a product of Taiwan.	0	0

1	B000CONMBS	A11EKBGXENMPUR	A substitute for popcorn addicts	"I first encountered this product at COSTCO.  When they discontinued it I decided to find another source.  I have diverticulosis and the doctor says I should avoid popcorn completely.  This is a wonderful substitute.  I also am diabetic and the product has no sugar and not too much carbohydrate either.  I thought 12 bags would last about 6 months.  I didn't count on my wife and son acquiring a taste for it as well.  Twelve bags is only about a three month supply.  While other flavors are available, I think the cheddar cheese flavor best approximates the flavor of buttered popcorn. I can now watch a movie and enjoy the old custom of munching on ""popcorn"".  (The product is also available in much smaller bags and 60 bags at once.  That is convenient for packing in lunches, but you pay more per ounce.)"	3	0
1	B0018CJJ9W	A2DRURXLBMP77K	Excellent alternative to overpriced Royal Canin (IVD) product	Our dog is on a lifelong limited ingredient diet due to inflammatory bowel disease.  He eats the venison & potato dry food and gets a low maintenance dose of prednisone.  The IVD (now Royal Canin) food worked well, but we've were outraged by the constant price hikes and annoyed by the inconvenience of only be able to buy the food at a vet.  Then we discovered Natural Balance.  On a price per pound basis it's about half the price. Our dog has done very well with this food.  Although there is no way for me to be sure, I also think it's likely that sweet potato is more nutritious than plain potato, so that's another benefit.  If you buy from Amazon there is free shipping and no sales tax, as well.<br />The food is a little more dense, so if you're switching from Royal Canin you might want to weigh your regular feeding of the old food, and determine how much of a scoop of the new food gives the same weight.  Not a big difference, but if you want to feed the exact same amount then go by weight.<br />Very pleased with this food.  It's still expensive, but not like the thuggish price gouging from Royal Canin.	4	0

1	B000VK6NDC	AUE05A41ALEPX	Highest quality, delicious food for your cats!	My cats both LOVE this food.  I've had varying success with about 7 different kinds of canned food.  This one is a hit with both.  It's natural, mostly organic, doesn't have any junk or fillers, and I have peace of mind knowing that we're giving them high quality food from an ethical company.  Since they've been on this diet they are more active, alert and happy.  Their coats are so soft and shiny and they seem to be shedding less.  Cannot say how relieved I am to have finally found a food they like that is so good for them as well.  It is pricey but if you want to save on costly vet bills down the road due to illness caused by poor nutrition, this is the way to go.	2	0

1	B0016JJEFG	A19EES077FPQO4	Always hits my tea spot right on!	Love this tea, and have ordered it multiple times. You could just say I'm hooked on it. Typically very deep flavors and very fresh. We take ours and keep it in a closed lid sealed container while we work thru the whole 100 bags of a box. The remaining boxes we keep factory sealed until we need to open. Also keep the sealed boxes out of direct light and in a cool food pantry. Hot water out of our Bunn coffee maker (it keeps hot water ready and can make a new pot of water or coffee within a minute or so) works very well & is the method I use the most often, but it can add some extra flavor to use water heated right to boil on the stove top, but takes a bit longer. We have other teas, but I always seem to drift back to this one. The volume pricing on Amazon makes it well worth ordering on-line -- we cannot find the same prices if we get it in the local stores, even if I factor in the shipping.	1	0

1	B002VVMAIQ	A2PE38AIGT3D1A	Great Travel organizer!	Gals, this Hadaki travel organizer is GREAT!  Perfect size and wonderful quality.  I use 2 -  one for my makeup and one for my toiletries.  Having 2 separate one's allows for me to keep things separate and make any last minute adjustments to my carry-on luggage in case my suitcase is over 50 lbs!  If all your toiletries (shampoos, body washes, lotions, etc.) are together with your makeup, you can't carry them on (liquids & gels over 2 oz).  It rolls up, but holds alot and has a nice, sturdy metal hanger hook so you can hang them on the back of the hotel bathroom doors.  These Hadaki cases are made with fabulous quality and I love them!  So will you.	5	0
1	B001YJBO4M	A1PI8VBCXXSGC7	These are good	On a whim, I bought an 8oz pkg of Diamond Glazed Walnuts on my last grocery shopping trip. These are very good. They're slightly sweet with a chewy crunch. My husband & I like eating them, as is, for a snack.  We also add them to Activia Vanilla yogurt along with some fruit. (Activia vanilla is the best tasting vanilla yogurt we've ever had). These walnuts would be good in an apple salad, too, or used as an ice cream topper, added to oatmeal, some cookie recipes or be used as a garnish.<br />Nutritional Facts:<br />140 Calories in 1/4 cup<br />10 gr.

We even tried a different Newmand's that ended up getting tossed - the dogs literally wouldn't touch them and acted outright offended at the suggestion this was their ""treat"". On the other hand, these were a hit. Rather than acting offended, they actually seemed to enjoy these. Bottom line - pooch approved."	1	1

-1	B000PDY3P0	A23AQVK82FKZRK	Popcorn Tastes Stale, Dry and Old	We had just received this afternoon  and popped one bag to share this eve. We followed directions exactly. You taste the hint of movie theatre popcorn, but this popcorn is not fresh. We were very disappointed and couldn't even eat what we had popped. We have had this type of product by a different name and maker at a friends home, and their product exceeded this one with more freshness and taste  in every way. I wanted to return immediately, but Amazon policy for this item wouldn't allow it. The best popcorn is fresh popcorn. All the kernels popped; nothing burned.This is just old stale popcorn. Obviously, I would never buy it again, nor would I ever recommend it!	0	2
1	B007M83302	A3H0NUX772TWVF	Delicious low fat treat.	Popchips are the best find I have found in a long time.  You want to eat healthy, and at the same time sometimes, you want something yummy.  Regular chips are high in fat, low fat chips give you stomach problems, baked chips taste not good to me, Popchips a little bit of heaven.  4 grams of fat vs. 10 of regular chips, they use sea salt, they crunch, and to me taste like regular chips minus the grease.  As usual, things that taste good and are made healthy cost more than the high fat item, that is just the way it seems to work.  However, this treat in my opinion is worth your money, as so many other healthy treats are expensive and taste not so great.  I hope you will enjoy them I do and my family does too.	0	0

1	B001EO69NS	A1L4RDILGM7D9E	Delicious yogurt!	This starter makes delicious yogurt. I like to use it with whole milk. You must first heat the milk up to at least 180 degrees and then cool it to 73-77 degrees. As the previous reviewer stated, you must use an icewater bath to cool the milk down. This works wonderfully. I let my yogurt incubate 15 hours and it is extremely thick and delicious! It has a bit of a tart taste, which is very yummy. I alternate using this yogurt with the Yogourmet freeze-dried yogurt for variety. I eat yogurt every single day and have been using Yogourmet starters for a couple of years now. I won't use any other brand as I've tried several and the ones from Yogourmet are the best.	28	3
1	B008ZRKZSM	AM0ALNK6K349Y	Odd but delicious	I was very skeptical about trying this product, but it is delicious! Even when mixed properly, the texture is not quite like commercial peanut butter.  To me, however, the flavor is almost identical to natural peanut butter.	2	0
-1	B000YSS7EO	A30NHVVC62LJMK	musty smell, baby could not stand it	This was my baby's first food (or at least I tried it) at 6 months. When I opened the can, a musty smell welcomed me. It had not gone bad from what I could see and it was well before the expiration date, it was just not terribly appetizing. Several times I went through the hassle of expressing breastmilk and mixing it with this stuff. There is no way I could get my baby to take this cereal, regardless of the milk to cereal ratio. I threw the stuff out and we went straight to real solids (non-pureed or mashed) after a few weeks. My baby has some preferences for which I do not want to rate this product poorly, however the musty smell was a turnoff for me too.	0	0

1	B0015R9BQG	A3HQET31VOG3KN	best vegetarian jerky	There really aren't any vegetarian jerkies that replace meat jerky.  Some vegetarian jerkies are so horrid, it is surprising they made it to market.<br /><br />Even in their tiny packages, a lot of vegetarian jerkies are so bad I can't finish them.<br /><br />But there are a lot of varieties of this brand that we like:  teriyaki, hickory, and thai peanut are our favorites.  This is seitan, which is a chewy gluten product.  It is stringy in texture, moist, and is a good match for the flavors.  There are some flavors I don't particularly like, such as the lime flavor, but even the ones I don't like seem like someone else would. (As in, I don't like barbecue potato chips, but I can see where someone else would.)	5	0
1	B003EML8PM	A1EDMRD18FRNU7	I LIKE 'em	I like them a lot. Got a batch after seeing it on a TV show. The first bag seemed a little 'off' to me, but then I realized it was bacause they were not fried. After that I like them a lot. I think they could be 'hotter'. I found that you want to start at the low end of the cooking time and work up. For me about 3 bags was enough to figure out that 1:08 was the 'perfect' time for my microwave. Long enough that they all 'pop' but not so long that anything happens to the early 'poppers'.<br /><br />My daughter loves them also, and we are going through them at a pretty good clip. I'm going to put them on auto reorder when this batch is gone. They are perfect for evening snacking when the mood hits. Since you make them as you eat them, never a stale bag! And the size is just about perfect for that.<br /><br />That's my 2 cents worth :)	3	0

1	B0030MNHEG	A2LEYFDG1OGP2V	Love it	The Offspring being my favorite band, I had to try this. It has a really good taste, and I can't get over Dexter on the label. XD<br />  PS- on their website, it has a recipe for beer mixed with some Gringo Bandito. For all the minors, just use coke. Not only is it good, but the reaction on people's face when you tell them it's mixed with hot sauce is priceless.<br />  And finally, my personal favorite is a Wahoos' fish taco with a lot of GB on it. THAT is amazing.	0	0

1	B002RKGEII	A3PO3YRFX4BI2J	Best Tahini I've had!	Having lived in the Middle East for 10 years, our family loves hummos and we make a lot of it.  This is the best brand I've ever found in the U.S.  I like the taste and the texture of this one, and it mixes wonderfully with the other ingredients.  I found it somewhere locally, then when I went to buy more I couldn't find it again.  Krinos is so much better than all the brands you find in health food stores or supermarkets, and the price happens to be about half of what most stores charge for a similar amount of tahini.  I was delighted to find it on Amazon!	1	0

1	B001ELL9X6	A2E3Q8U8364F5P	Great Tea	I hardly ever write reviews but this tea is quite excellent.  I decided to try it without any sweetener or any other added taste enhancers.  It is flavorful without being overpowering.  It is a great pleasure to have a fine tea like this loose and reasonably priced.  After the first try I have continued to drink it just as it comes.  You can see by the leaves once they are soaked that it is a premium tea.	0	0

However, it was disappointing that this product was a Canadian one. I think that it should have been clear on the website, Canadian import. Maybe it's there and I just didn't notice. I ended up sending it back. I will say that the store I bought it from (Entirely Pets) was very prompt in shipping it out, but not as prompt with the refund process. I had to call twice to find out what was going on. I had gotten a return authorization number prior to shipping it back, so I'm not sure what held up the process."	1	18

Then all of a sudden, within seconds, it spread to my senses and my taste buds were happy. As close to Thai food as a potato chip can get.  These chips are spicy enough to satisfy that craving for spice and a hint of sweetness that makes them habit forming. The flavoring included garlic, ginger, jalapeno, cilantro and other spices, and it just felt great to eat these. I will buy these again. These were a treat.	0	0

I did a search for healthy treats and came across these happy hips.  The ingredients are natural and she absolutely loves them.  The idea that it is also benefitial for her joints adds a special bonus to the product.  No sugar or garbage in these.  I have been keying in on more protein in her diet as she has had digestive problems.  She has had not problems since I changed.  You can't go wrong with these.	0	1
-1	B002Y7520K	A26RIN52UDSLHV	Not NEARLY as strong as claimed!	In the attempt to make blueberry cake for my brother, I used the WHOLE bottle and STILL didn't have a blueberry cake.  I added about half the bottle to the cake mix (white cake--NOT vanilla), and the other half to the frosting (white frosting--NOT vanilla) and it still only had a HINT of blueberry flavor.  I was completely disappointed in all the time, effort and money spent making it, and it barely tasted blueberry.  I would have thought that using the WHOLE bottle would have made a blueberry flavor.  I guess I will have to see if I can find actual blueberry extract and not blueberry FLAVORED extract.  Will not be wasting my money on this again.  :(	0	0

1	B003LPQE8I	AY1EF0GOH80EK	If you're allergic to egg yolks, this is your mayo!	This mayo is made with egg whites and no yolks, hard to find a good tasting mayo without them being front and center.  I tried MANY yolkless mayos before this and had given up hope of ever finding one I could stand.  I am so glad I tried this, it is the best mayo I have ever had out of a jar!  I am so excited to be able to have a seafood salad sandwich again :)<br /><br />This tastes better than regular Hellmans/Best Foods mayo, and it tastes nothing like Miracle Whip (which I hate).  It is smooth and rich and helps combine any salad-style mix you have going without adding any off flavors.  I actually never put mayo on sandwiches before, just used it as an ingredient, but I may start since this is so tasty!<br /><br />The four-pack is a great value.	0	0

The Bouquet arrived exactly at its destination when I was told it would, and was apparently beautifully and impecibly packaged with a lovely message card, also inside were all the care instruction for the flowers and flower food etc. My friend has told me ""You could not have walked and picked these flowers from a field any fresher"" that they are an enormous arrangement with so many flowers and colours it was hard for her to describe, and best of all is they are sented, and very beautifully sented. My friends were just so overwhelmed by the package and are frightened I've spent to much, I've told her to look on line because I am so thrilled with the service. And certainly my friends in the States are going to be using this service and Falcon Farms for sending flowers to there loved ones now.<br />To get this kind of Bouquet delivered here within the UK would have cost about £ 80(at the very least) and I kid not. I'm just jelous now that I can't experience the Falcon Farms flowers over here!!!!<br /><br />Thank you for letting me send a token of love this way, and making it a pleasure, I would definitely use this service again."	3	0
1	B006QQ2P3M	A23TMSCMNUII12	First night, easier to remember	I've only taken this product once as I recieved it two days ago. I must say that while I wasn't able to achieve lucidity just yet (I've only achieved this once and it was without the extract, several months ago- One of the reasons I was looking into this herb) my dream recall was much better. The dream was certainly more vivid, and I can see that with more practice this (Although admittedly vile tasting and smelling) herb extract will be a valuable tool for me. Thanks	3	1
1	B001GVISJC	A3BDOAPSF96WGQ	Bigger then other brands	Grape gummy bears are hard to find in my area. In fact pretty much anyone I talk to about grape gummy bears they think I'm lying. So I bought 10lbs... : ) These bears are a little bit bigger then the other brands and have kind of sour kick, but nothing to strong. I love grape flavored candy/soda and these are pretty good. There is another company that makes grape gummy bears that are a little bit better in my opinion, but these are well worth it for the price. I like to use the gummy bears in home made Popsicles with flavored sports drink. The salt in the sports drink makes for softer popsicles, and the gummy bears are awesome frozen. They are delicious!	1	0

I have given one to every tea loving person I know and they ALL loved it!<br /><br />I rarely drink any tea but Numi anymore.

1	B008ZRKZSM	A1MV5RFJETWSR7	PB2 Is A Dream Come True!	After reading the wonderful reviews of PB2, I was still skeptical but every rave review was right on the money!!<br /><br />The reduction in fat and calories is a gift from the peanut butter gods.  The fact that you mix it up as you go (which takes, literally, no more than 15 seconds) is a great help for people like me who sometimes like to settle down with a jar of peanut butter and a spoon, only to realize a zillion calories later what I have done.  You can control the texture by adding or subtracting the water recommended.  There's plenty of peanut flavor and they've added a bit of sugar (I assume to offset the lack of fat) but it is a very small amount and still adds far less in calories than all that subtracted fat and oil.<br /><br />The chocolate PB2 is also completely awesome.  I eat it straight and it's almost like chocolate mousse.  Sometimes I pop in a little regular PB2 if I'm not wanting it so sweet but any way you mix it, it rocks.<br /><br />I ordered and received $100.00 worth and I love the comfort of knowing my PB2 is there for the forseeable future.<br /><br />I hope that the word gets out to all the people who will love this product.<br /><br />Give it a try, you won't be sorry!

1	B000121BY6	A21243B24Q0P5Q	Orangina! My Favorite Little Juice Friend!	"Nothing is as comforting and as fun as the orangina bottle. The photo does not do it justice at all. It is almost spherical and fairly stubby. Although it says ""citrus"" it is sooo orangee that well, you don't taste much else. The other citrus flavors are only in the form of subtle hints. Drinking orangina is almost like having aromatherapy. It is an adult and child pleaser, too. This is the beverage that allowed our children to ""have a soda"" without having a soda. We are a no pop household. It is also wonderful poured into a more sophisticated goblet, the flavor is alluring and can almost be called pretentious when properly served in place of a dessert liquor or wine spritzer. A lot of us adult Earth pod dwellers don't drink alcohol but want the joy of sipping and savoring. Great beverage. A treat like Polinarious. Enjoy. oh, and the pulp, hardly!"	2	0
-1	B004391DK0	A2M1FMU266MVON	These are gross	These pancakes are gross... they are pale and do not taste like pancakes. I bought these based on the reviews because the Maple Grove Farms pancakes were out of stock that week. I expected a lot more from Bisquick. I mean, when these pancakes are fully cooked they look like pale wafers of cream of wheat. If you leave them in a little longer to get some color, they just get hard and taste worse. I hate wasting food so I forced myself to finish the 3 boxes.. but I dont think I'll buy these again even if my other ones are out of stock. The only reason I gave these 2 stars is because they are gluten free. Other than that they're awful.. I'm so glad I've got my Maple Groves back this week and that these are out of my pantry!	0	2

1	B0016FRI8A	A1VQKT0EFQ3Q2K	Great product - at last!	LOVE this!  I dislike drinking plain water and have been looking for something easy that I could add to my s/s water bottle (gotta be good to the environment, right?)  The flavor is great, ease of convenience is wonderful and the hint of sweet is not overpowering at all.  I can drink my green tea with or without sweetener.  The only thing is if you want to drink green tea all day long, the calories WILL add up - I think each packet is 60 calories.  I drink 2 (32 oz) bottles of water a day so that would be 120 calories of sweetened drink a day.  But I will still give the product 5 stars because the product is fab.  I'd just pick something else if I'm going to pound water all day long (perhaps the blueberry green tea one which is NOT sweetened - it's excellent as well)  I'll use this for one bottle and a non-sweetened one for the other.  Best of both worlds.  Enjoy!	1	1

It is so nice to wake up and just hit a button for instant coffee and have so many choices for a different cup every day. This particular model came with a coupon for a first time free box of K-cups! Which was a bonus. Only down side to this model is that there are only 2 sized of cups it can make and neither are big enough to fill a mug. Also the machine is noisy, but only when you are brewing which is about 20 seconds. Such a please to have and a nice design. Loving it!	0	0

They flourish on this diet and don't have any of the problems they used to have.  That being said I wasn't certain how they'd react to these treats.  The dogs love them and we haven't had any GI tract problems.  They've had no bad reactions whatsoever to them.<br /><br />The treats are 2 1"" x 1"" squares attached together, with a line incised between the squares so they can be broken apart for smaller dogs.  They are fairly thick and substantial enough that it takes a few minutes for our dogs to finish them.  They don't wolf them down in one gulp which is a good thing.  The package has a good number of treats too.  I also appreciate the source of the lamb, New Zealand, and the fact they are organic.<br /><br />I'll be buying these again.  They love lamb, enjoy the treats and I think they are a good value."	0	1

1	B005K4Q1VI	A32HA9IME9E88V	So much better than Cafe Escapes!	After being disgusted by the brown water created by the Cafe Escapes dark chocolate cocoa, we were THRILLED to find these dark chocolate cocoa k-cups.  Delicious!	0	0

1	B001BDDTB2	AZFHSPEZUPGD2	Looks and smells high-quality, kitty likes it	My cat, who is of average pickiness, loved both of the chicken varieties.<br /><br />The Sesame Chicken looks and smells appealing, even to humans.  It's very recognizable as shredded white-meat chicken, finely diced carrots, and broth.  No chopped-and-formed meat by-products here!<br /><br />The Chicken Pot Pie variety is a little smellier, but not as bad as typical cat food.  It is fairly soupy, but my cat lapped it right up.  She even ate the carrots, which I would not have anticipated.<br /><br />Both products list high-quality ingredients on the label.  There is no wheat gluten, so hopefully this product is less susceptible to the melamine poisonings that have occurred with other brands.  It is made in Thailand, and I don't know what that means in terms of pet food safety.<br /><br />I like the size of the mini-cans, as they are just right for one meal for one cat.  I hate keeping smelly half-open cans of pet food in the refrigerator!	0	0
-1	B0078Y6OX8	AG2S7N7ZPPNW2	Not for me	I love all things Raspberry and Chocolate, but this did not do it for me. I don't like strong coffee and WOW is this strong. I only drank one cup out of a box of 48 k-cups.	0	0
1	B000FAMURQ	A1D7SKBDFLSKFX	Precut makes it easier	No matter what sized pan, this always seems to be the right size to line it.  I also use it for covering when I microwave. Works great with roasting veggies and baking cookies.  And you can use it a few times too, don't have to throw it away right away.	1	0
-1	B001P1V2UK	AV43UL9S8TUK8	Not a genuine Terrafina product	I purchased this product from Otto's because the offering via Amazon Prime was out of stock.  Otto's shipped me four plain tubs without Terrafina labels and sealed with a vertical X of clear packing tape rather than Terrafina's vacuum seal where the tub and the cover meet.  I called Otto's within a few days of receipt and they said they buy in bulk from Terrafina and package it themselves.  They said they were out of Terrafina labels!  Two of the tubs developed mold within a few days of my call to Otto's and I had to throw all of them out.  I am now seeking a refund from Amazon.	0	0
1	B007M83302	A31Q59TUS9T6H0	AMAZING!	Can't believe they are only 100 calories a bag and pack so much flavor! Tried them in NYC last week and of course can't find them where I live but thanks to Amazon.com I can get them whenever I want and at a great price too! The single bags were selling in NYC for $1.29 to $1.50 a bag. It's a lot cheaper buying the 24 pack here!<br />Looking forward to trying the other flavors, but so far Salt & Pepper are my favorite!	1	0
1	B000LKXQ32	A2L1SNVFML2CUQ	The best organic green tea available in teabags.	Brew it correctly and you really get a beautiful cup of tea.  I highly recommend this brand.  It is by far the best bagged green tea I have found, and I have tried about all of them.  I brew one bag in a 12 oz mug for 2 minutes.  Absolutely perfect.	2	0
1	B0029O0EFG	A1HZGQ44DFK6T0	Best Dry Food!	I have tried numerous dry cat foods, but the one my cats like best is the Goodlife Recipe! Not sure if it's the yummy aroma, or just the sound of it being poured into their bowls, but they sure come running!  I feed our cats canned food, but always have a bowl of dry food available. Some of our cats prefer dry food, and this recipe is a winner! I like the fact that it's high in protein and has fiber and veggies too.<br />Try it- you won't be disappointed!!<br />Pricing on Amazon is great, the automatic delivery is a godsend- and free delivery is a winner!	0	0
1	B009NTCO4O	A8Y0K5BEEW2LP	Sampler Cheesecake	It's absolutely delicious.  This is the best cheesecake I have ever eaten.  I highly recommend it.  So, what are you waiting for?  Order it!<br /><br />You can thaw out the slices the way I did if you like.  At 30% power, heat 4 slices in a regular microwave for about 55 seconds.  Don't cover them while you are doing this.  Plus, there are slips of paper between each slice, so you need not cut anything or worry about adhesions.	1	0
1	B004391DK0	A3UHV6YPZG7L51	Just like the Bisquick you remember	I find the gluten-free Bisquick pancake mix to be just as easy to use as the original Bisquick, and I like the flavor just fine (not much different than regular Bisquick).  It's easy to make the pancakes, just add milk, oil, an egg, mix, and pour on the griddle.  Cooking time seems to be about the same, and the consistency of the pancakes is just like regular pancakes.  I would definitely recommend this mix to anyone needing gluten-free products.	1	0

-1	B000E1588O	A2VBVJJK9N5Q5Y	Despite the reviews here, I think most people would agree with me.	Wow, very weird taste.  I typically like all the ingredients, but this mix just tastes wrong.  It's somewhat similar to sarsaparilla tea, but with a licorice aftertaste.  It isn't so bad that I couldn't finish the first cup, but not my cup of tea.	0	5

1	B002GWH5OY	ADCMD5XKEDD6X	Simply great!	This is delicious coffee which compares favorably with much higher priced coffee.  It's a well-kept secret!  Low acidity and smooth taste are hallmarks of this brew.<br /><br />I especially liked the fact that each bag is resealable to keep the coffee at maximum freshness.  I will definitely buy again and again.	0	0

1	B00622CYVI	A59BC7H4T874H	Good stuff	My son happily eats all of the fruit/veggie varieties of Earth's Best, unlike the Organic Baby products, none of which he likes at all.<br /><br />Be careful to only get the fruit and veggie variety packs, not the dinner packs, as they have meat in them.	3	2
1	B001CWV4PA	A5HQKHJ30W1Z3	Long search over	I have been looking for a cracker that kind of passes off as a saltine cracker. My Mom's recipes require saltine crackers and so having celiac disease I have gone without! Now I can enjoy some of the recipes that I have grown up with. They also are good for snacking crackers. I thought they tasted like a cross between saltines and ritz. My husband went with a kinda grahm crackery taste. They are the first gluten free cracker I have found that are not so crispy they crack in pieces!!	0	0

-1	B00622CYVI	A3TUTIAVU7Q2E2	Normally love Earths Best	I usually feed Earth's Best baby food to my grandson. He has never had a reaction of any kind to any baby food I have given him. This is the first time I have tried this particular variety pack. I fed him the Peach Oatmeal Banana and Apples and Apricots for breakfast this morning. Shortly after I noticed he was scratching. I looked and he had a rash. I remembered reading a baby food review where someone mentioned an allergy so I checked and yes it is this variety pack. I don't know what is in it that would cause this type of reaction. Unfortunately I fed him two different jars so I don't know which one caused it but I don't want to take a chance of him having another one so out they go. Just thought I would let others know.	1	1
1	B0078Y6OX8	A1ZQDNKY34BLNR	Great French Vanilla Cup	"I've tried so many K-cups. The greatest problem I have with K-cups is many are too weak for me and I've never liked a ""strong"" cup of coffee. You know the one's that make your grow chest hair. I've tried many flavored K-cups but all are a milder coffee for some reason. However, I'm so glad I found this vanilla k-cup. I can actually taste the vanilla and coffee in my cup of coffee with this k-cup. I enjoyed my sample of this so much that I bought 2 boxes of 48ct in addition to the Hazelnut. I hope the Hazelnut is just as good."	0	0
1	B002OFZIV0	A2LZSV7ZEBJ5CP	Much better than beef	These are really good. Not hard to chew like some other beef nuggets, and they don't dry out so much.<br /><br />They only downside is that the bag stays very moist inside, so it can be a little messy.

Since then I have searched for ANYTHING similar. When I realized I couldn't find it, she had forgotten what one she purchased.<br /><br />This one has a strong flavor, but it tastes fake with a strong after taste. Unfortunately it is one of the better ones.  If anyone reads this and knows what ones (Carmel and Vanilla), taste great, please post here.	0	0
-1	B002FVQX3A	AGMRFA08XBU53	I must be allergic	"I've never had an allergic reaction to any food, or anything else, in my life.  But within 20 seconds of starting to chew a piece of this gum, my throat began to burn and my airway became constricted.  That's strange, because I've been chewing spearmint and peppermint ice cubes for a while now with no reaction.  I ""tasted"" another piece from another pack (we get this stuff free at the dining facility here in Iraq), and again, my throat started burning.  So, if you have a history of food allergies, you might not want to try this flavor."	1	1
1	B001EO5UW4	A3N88HH0G8RBLD	God sent for minor digestive issues	I have to warn that my review is going to sound like I sell this product.<br />I wish I know how to make them but I don't.<br /><br />Next time you have minor digestive issues or stomach gas or nausea try one of these babies!<br />Just put it on your tongue and take in the juices.<br />You will feel better in 5 minutes.<br /><br />Just a little bit of history.<br />When I was growing up, I knew them as Al Bukhara.  My father used to regulary eat them.<br />50 years later, when I recently had stomach ailment, I remembered about them.<br />My wife found them at a local middle-east store under the same name. They are made in Iran.<br />Unfortunately, the store stopped selling them and had to look for an alternative and found the golden prunes from Sadaf.<br />They are not as good as Al Bukhara but next best thing and work well.<br /><br />I have been using these for two years and they work every single time.<br />But watch out, they will make you hungry; I am not kidding!<br /><br />Now, here is the most important thing<br />I found that not all dried prunes are as effective. In fact most of them don't do anything.<br />The prunes need to be moist, golden or light brown and soft. Sadaf also sells pitted prunes; don't buy them for relief from digestive issues or just to clear your stomach.<br /><br />Amazon has been out of stock for a while now.  I buy them locally.<br />If you don't have access to such a store, Sadaf sells them online.	0	0
1	B0026LN472	A25I6FGSZEP5Q	My cats love it, and it's healthy.	I learned about this product from the shelter where I adopted my newest cat who is 3 years old.  They recommended it strongly, so I introduced it to my 14-year old who preferred it over Science Diet. Now I can feed both age groups the same food. I like the fact that the ingredients are all natural and healthy.  It's hard to find the 15-lb bag, so I like buying this from Amazon.	0	0

1	B004OLKF60	A2SZLNSI5KOQJT	Bold But Not Rocket Fuel Bold.  Nice, Smooth Flavor.	This Barista Prima kcup is my favorite of the four Barista Prima varieties that I've tried (House Blend, Columbian, Italian Rost & French Roast).  It has a nice dark, moderately bold flavor that creates a smooth wake-me-up in the morning.  There is no kick to it - just a even, enjoyable experience.<br /><br />My coffee preferences are medium-bold blends.  I brew a 10oz cup & this coffee maintains its flavor in this size cup.<br /><br />This is a kcup that I would put on my shelves.  Recommended.<br /><br />Disclosure:  I received this kcup in a sample variety pack sent our by Keurig to its customers.	1	0

1	B001TM3XKW	AYLDAOVZL17RL	Weruva Bed and Breakfast Canned Dog Food	Although this is very expensive canned dog food we found it well worth the cost.  We own a Golden Retriever Saluki mix that is extremely particular about what she eats and she rarely accepts canned dog food. However, she loves the Weruva Bed and Breakfast. It is extremely moist and contains lots of broth in addition to the meats and vegetables that she likes best. We normally boil chicken, rice, carrots and broth and make her a stew that she eats with great enthusiasm.  Until I purchased this Weruva product I could find no canned dog food that came close to what we make her at home.  Weruva is almost exactly what we fix her. I have continued to use this product regularly.  It is the best canned dog food I have found.	3	0

-1	B004ZIER34	AI0PLL5DQAHRG	An acquired taste perhaps?	For those who love coffee but have bad heartburn issues, low acid coffee like the Puroast dark French roast may be a decent choice.  Pretty much anyone else can easily skip it, however, as the taste and smell are both frankly supbar.<br /><br />Clearly other reviewers have enjoyed this coffee, so individual taste reactions may vary, but I'm baffled at why this is advertised as being less bitter than standard coffee. It has a very strong and unpleasant chemical taste that is significantly more bitter than nearly any other coffee I've had in recent memory.<br /><br />This may not be an issue for everyone, but it's worth noting that the Puroast low acid variety doesn't create that wonderful brewed coffee aroma at all. You have to put your nose directly next to the cup to smell it at all, and then the result is an off-putting chemical scent to match the flavor. Having my kitchen fill up with that distinctive scent to let everyone know the coffee is ready is a major part of the coffee drinking experience, and this brand doesn't offer that.<br /><br />It seems like Puroast may be an acquired taste, but after four cups and trying the coffee both black and with different creamer options, I certainly didn't acquire it and can't recommend it to anyone who doesn't have a serious heartburn problem.	0	0

1	B001RQAVKK	A3M174IC0VXOS2	MY COMFORT FOOD	There's something very special about foods you've grown up with.  The taste reminds you of home, perhaps of childhood and happy memories.

Well, I've given up the peanut butter but the jelly is still one of my favorite comfort foods.	2	3
-1	B000I1RHMU	A2MXOXSIY0OUXS	Very strange flavor	"I tried this brand of green tea after drinking both Celestial Seasonings and Twinings green teas. This one had a very strong, very strange flavor. It almost tasted like a meat broth rather than a tea. I think another reviewer who described it as a ""burnt"" flavor may have gotten it right. I tried it once, and immediately switched back to Twinings. I recently tried a second bag, thinking maybe I overreacted the first time, but had to pour it away."	1	0

I wasn't sure what to expect by the package, and at first bite I didn't know what to think...and then all of the flavors hit!<br />Yum! They are a bit spicy, but nothing overpowering. Just lots of crunchy, sweet, spicy goodness. They aren't sold everywhere though, I'm still trying to find them somewhere close to where I live.	0	0
-1	B00622CYVS	A6A2ANBK76EV2	Agree with the other reviewers	"Don't let the ""Earth's Best"" name fool you .. as stated in multiple reviews here - CHECK THE INGREDIENTS!  No wonder so many positive reviews here have the same theme, ""My kids will only eat Earth's Best!"" .. Well that's because they are all SWEETENED, which is one of the worst things you can feed to your child regularly.  They WILL develop a sweet tooth QUICKLY, and will start rejecting pure vegetables / other good things because of this.  There is no need to inject applesauce or other sweeteners into other foods.  That's just shameful, and there is only one reason for it - so the child will eat it and only want this brand.<br /><br />Best advice - if you must buy pre-made food, be sure the ingredients are just the main ingredient(s) and (if needed) water.  That's it.  Don't buy a vegetable that has ""applesauce"" or another silly ingredient added just to make the child love it and want that brand because it's sweetened.<br /><br />Shame on Earth's Best as a company.  Kudos to their marketing department for creating a name whereas consumers will automatically be drawn to them because they think it's a great product based solely on the name."	6	9

-1	B0044UO9FY	A27Z2NIR4V446L	Candy look liked it was open & it is OLD. Do not Buy!	I bought this bag and found it 50% cheaper at smart and final. It was also old and and white. This was terrible! I bought it to put in the candy canisters I give to co-workers. So I didn't find out it was OLD till a co-worker informed me. I was so embarrassed. Do not buy this candy. It all ended up in the trash. Very disappointed!	9	0
-1	B0013NUGDE	A2YDU3RZB63VXW	Holy SALT, Batman!	"We are chip fanatics in our house and we decided to try these because of their claim of being a ""healthier"" alternative to regular chips.  I will admit that they have a great crunch - something between a ricecake and a kettle chip.  The texture is also very nice, again - similar to a ricecake, but with a great potato flavor.  The big issue with these is the sodium level.  After about four or five chips they're almost unbearable because of the salt and you really stop tasting anything but the salt.  A review of the nutritional facts showed that the sodium per serving was almost double that of a standard potato chip serving and that was for their ""original"" flavor...I can't imagine what the ""Salt & Pepper"" style must be like.<br /><br />I would buy these regularly if they cut the salt by about 75%.  Because of the salt factor, I don't think you can call these a ""healthy"" alternative to chips."	45	7
